Since both trains travel the same distance, we can call this distance x. We know that the total distance covered by both trains in the first day is 80 miles, so we can set up the equation: x + x = 80. Combining like terms, we get 2x = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40. So, each train travels 40 miles westward on the first day.\n\nNext, we need to find the distance covered by each train in the second day, when they travel northward. Again, since both trains travel the same distance, we can call this distance y. We know that the total distance covered by both trains in the second day is 150 miles, so we can set up the equation: y + y = 150. Combining like terms, we get 2y = 150. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 75. So, each train travels 75 miles northward on the second day.\n\nNow, we need to find the total distance covered by each train in the two days. We can do this by adding the distance covered in the first day to the distance covered in the second day. For the first train, the total distance is 40 + 75 = 115 miles. For the second train, the total distance is also 40 + 75 = 115 miles.\n\nTherefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 115 miles.

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 5. We know that the total number of cars on the motorway was 30, and 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the equation can be set up as: x + (x + 5) = 30 - 20. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 5 = 10. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 2x = 5. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 2.5. However, since we can't have a fraction of a car, this means that the problem statement is inconsistent, and there is no integer solution for x. But, if we assume that the problem statement is correct and x must be an integer, we can try to find the closest integer solution. Since x + 5 must be less than or equal to 30, we can try x = 2, which gives us 2 + 5 = 7, and 7 is less than 30. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 2. However, this is not the only possible solution.

    "raw": "<think> Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet Julia rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. \n\nSince it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.\n\nNow, we need to find the rate of water intake in liters per second. Since the boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet, and we know the rate of rowing is 1.25 feet/second, we can set up a proportion to find the rate of water intake: 2 liters / 10 feet = x liters / 1 foot. Solving for x, we get x = 0.2 liters/foot.\n\nNow that we have the rate of water intake, we can find the total amount of water taken on by the time Julia reaches the shore. The shore is 64 seconds away, and we know the rate of rowing is 1.25 feet/second. So, the distance to the shore is 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.\n\nSince the boat takes on 0.2 liters of water for every foot rowed, the total amount of water taken on is 80 feet * 0.2 liters/foot = 16 liters.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, not every foot. So, for every 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters, and for the remaining 0 feet (since 80 feet is a multiple of 10), the boat takes on 0 liters. Therefore, the total amount of water taken on is 8 * 2 = 16 liters.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the boat takes on water at a rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet, and the distance to the shore is 80 feet, which is 8 sets of 10 feet. So, the boat takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters for the first 80 feet. But this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and the distance to the shore is 64 seconds away. We can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second. The distance to the shore is 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.\n\nSince the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can find the number of 10-foot intervals in 80 feet: 80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals. Therefore, the boat takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water for the first 80 feet.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the boat takes on water at a rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet, and the distance to the shore is 64 seconds away. We can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second. The distance to the shore is 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.\n\nSince the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can find the number of 10-foot intervals in 80 feet: 80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals. Therefore, the boat takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water for the first 80 feet.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.

    "answer": "It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.\nThus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.\nIn those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.\nThus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.\n#### 16"

    "answer": "First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons\nLet b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32\nSubtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16\nDividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8"

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg. \n\nNow, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount of rice consumed per day (2 kg). 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of weeks, so we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 21 days by 7 days/week to get 3 weeks.\n\nTherefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. \n\nHowever, we need to find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 5 members eating rice every lunch and dinner. Since the calculation above is for 2 meals per day, we need to multiply the result by 2 to account for the additional meal. 3 weeks * 2 = 6 weeks.\n\nSo, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 6 weeks for 5 members eating rice every lunch and dinner. \n\n</think>\n<answer> 6 </answer>",
    "answer": "Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.\nSo, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.\nIn a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.\nThus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.\n#### 3"

We are given that 22 men stayed, so the number of men who left is M - 22 = 25 - 22 = 3. The total number of people who left is M - 22 + (W - x), where x is the number of women who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can set up the equation: 1/4 * (M + W) = M - 22 + (W - x). We know that M = 25 and W = 15, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 1/4 * (25 + 15) = 25 - 22 + (15 - x). Simplifying the equation, we get: 1/4 * 40 = 3 + 15 - x. 10 = 18 - x. x = 8.

We can set up the equation: 2/5 * x = 12.8. To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5/2, which is the reciprocal of 2/5. This gives us: x = 12.8 * (5/2). To simplify the right-hand side, we multiply 12.8 by 5 and then divide by 2. 12.8 * 5 = 64, and 64 / 2 = 32. Therefore, x = 32.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and we know that the total number of days in April is 30, we can set up the equation x + x = 30, which simplifies to 2x = 30.\n8. Solving for x, we get x = 15.\n9. Now that we know x, we can substitute it into the equation 3yx = 1125 to solve for y. We get 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.\n10. Solving for y, we get y = 1125 / 45 = 25.\n11. Since the daily savings in the second half is 2y, we can calculate it as 2(25) = 50.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> 50 </answer>",

    "answer": "The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months\nSo he paid for expensive research for 50-5=<<50-5=45>>45 months\nEach month of research at the cheaper stage cost 100,000/5=$<<100000/5=20000>>20,000\nSo the more expensive research cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000\nSo that research cost 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000\nSo the total cost was 1,350,000+100,000=$<<1350000+100000=1450000>>1,450,000\n#### 1,450,000"

    "raw": "<think> Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as x. The total cost of the classes will be the cost per class times the number of classes, minus the cost of the classes Manny misses. The cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 10 - 6x. We want this to be less than or equal to 10 * 6, since the parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class is more than $10. So, we have the inequality 6 * 10 - 6x <= 10 * 6. We can simplify this to 60 - 6x <= 60. Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us -6x <= 0. Dividing both sides by -6 gives us x >= 0. However, we know that x must be an integer, since it represents the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is 0. However, this is not the answer we are looking for, since we want to know how many classes he can miss before they don't sign him up again. So, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss before the cost per class is more than $10. Let's try x = 1. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 9 - 6 * 1 = 54. The cost per class is 54 / 9 = 6, which is less than $10. Let's try x = 2. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 8 - 6 * 2 = 48. The cost per class is 48 / 8 = 6, which is less than $10. Let's try x = 3. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 7 - 6 * 3 = 42. The cost per class is 42 / 7 = 6, which is less than $10. Let's try x = 4. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 6 - 6 * 4 = 36. The cost per class is 36 / 6 = 6, which is less than $10. Let's try x = 5. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 5 - 6 * 5 = 30. The cost per class is 30 / 5 = 6, which is less than $10. Let's try x = 6. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 4 - 6 * 6 = 24. The cost per class is 24 / 4 = 6, which is less than $10. Let's try x = 7. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 3 - 6 * 7 = 18. The cost per class is 18 / 3 = 6, which is less than $10. Let's try x = 8. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 2 - 6 * 8 = 12. The cost per class is 12 / 2 = 6, which is less than $10. Let's try x = 9. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 1 - 6 * 9 = 0. The cost per class is 0 / 1 = 0, which is less than $10. Let's try x = 10. The total cost of the classes will be 6 * 0 - 6 * 10 = -60. The cost per class is -60 / 0, which is undefined. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class is more than $10 is 9. However, we are looking for the number of classes he can miss before they don't sign him up again, which is one less than the maximum number of classes he can miss before the cost per class is more than $10.

Then, the total amount from red hats is $400, and the total amount from green hats is 2x (since it's twice the amount from red hats).\n\nWe can set up an equation based on this information:\n\nTotal sales in the first month = $400 + 2x\n\nSince the total sales in the first month is the sum of sales from red and green hats, we can set up an equation:\n\n$400 + 2x = Total sales in the first month\n\n2. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's call the total sales in the first month y. Then, the total sales in the second month is 3/4y.\n\nWe can set up an equation based on this information:\n\nTotal sales in the second month = 3/4y\n\n3. The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the total sales in the first month and the total sales in the second month:\n\nTotal amount made in two months = y + 3/4y\n\nTo find the total amount made in two months, we need to find the value of y.\n\n4. We can find the value of y by using the fact that the total sales in the first month is $400 + 2x. Since the total sales in the first month is equal to y, we can set up an equation:\n\n$400 + 2x = y\n\n5. We also know that the total sales in the first month is equal to the total sales from red hats plus the total sales from green hats. Since the total sales from green hats is 2x, we can set up an equation:\n\n$400 + 2x = 2x + x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$400 = x\n\n6. Now that we know the value of x, we can find the value of y:\n\ny = $400 + 2x\n= $400 + 2($400)\n= $800 + $800\n= $1600\n\n7. Now that we know the value of y, we can find the total amount made in two months:\n\nTotal amount made in two months = y + 3/4y\n= $1600 + 3/4($1600)\n= $1600 + $1200\n= $2800\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> 2800 </answer>",
    "answer": "Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.\nHer total sales in the first month are $800+$400=$<<800+400=1200>>1200.\nIn the second month, she made 3/4*1200=$<<3/4*1200=900>>900.\nThe total amount of money Ariadne made from two months of sales is $1200+$900=$<<1200+900=2100>>2100.\n#### 2100"

We also know that y = x + 7 - 7, since the triplet is 7 years younger than the older twin. Substituting y = x into the equation, we get x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 - 7) = 44. Combining like terms, we get 3x + 7 = 44. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 3x = 37. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 37/3. However, x must be an integer, so this is not a valid solution.

We need to find out how many hours they need to fundraise in total to reach their goal. \n\nLet's denote the total number of hours they need to fundraise as x. Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, the amount raised in x hours will be $2100 + (x-3) * (amount raised per hour). \n\nWe know that the total amount raised in x hours should be equal to the goal of $6300. \n\nSo, we can set up the equation: 2100 + (x-3) * (amount raised per hour) = 6300. \n\nSince they raise an equal amount in every hour, the amount raised per hour is the total goal divided by the number of hours they have already raised, which is 6300 / 3 = 2100 / 3 = 700. \n\nNow we can substitute this value into the equation: 2100 + (x-3) * 700 = 6300. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 2100 + 700x - 2100 = 6300. \n\nCombine like terms: 700x = 6300. \n\nDivide both sides by 700: x = 9. \n\nSo, they need to fundraise for 9 hours in total to reach their goal. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 9. \n\n<answer> 9 </answer>",

Since each class has the same number of students, let's call the number of students in each class x.\n3. The total number of students in both classes is the sum of the students in each class, so we can write the equation: x + x = 80\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 80\n5.

We also know that she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. Additionally, she uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. \n\nLet's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of salt and sugar is also x. \n\nSince she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2x. \n\nWe are given that the total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, so we can set up the equation: x + x + 2x + x + x = 10. \n\nCombining like terms, we get 7x = 10. \n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides by 7: x = 10/7. \n\nNow that we know the value of x, we can find the amount of oil by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2(10/7) = 20/7. \n\nTo convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 20/7 = 2.857. \n\nHowever, the problem asks for the amount of oil in ounces, and we are given that the jar is 10 ounces.

Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total distance traveled by the kangaroos as 3 times the speed of a kangaroo times 18 hours. \n\nLet's denote the speed of a kangaroo as K.

Since the pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, we can assume that one adult's bowl is equivalent to one and a half child's bowls. \n\nLet's calculate the total number of bowls that can be filled with the soup. Since there are 4 adults and 2 children, the total number of bowls that can be filled is 4 (adults) + 2 (children) = 6 bowls.\n\nSince each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, we can calculate the total number of child's bowls that can be filled as follows: 6 (total bowls) * 1.5 (child's bowl size) = 9 child's bowls.\n\nSince there are 2 children, we can divide the total number of child's bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 9 (child's bowls) / 2 (children) = 4.5.\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Since there are 6 bowls in total and 4 people (2 adults and 2 children) eating, there will be 6 - 4 = 2 bowls of soup left.\n\nSince each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, we can calculate the number of child's bowls that can be filled with the remaining soup as follows: 2 (remaining bowls) * 1.5 (child's bowl size) = 3 child's bowls.\n\nSince there are 2 children, we can divide the total number of child's bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 3 (child's bowls) / 2 (children) = 1.5.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 more time.\n\nIn total, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 4 + 1 = 5 times. \n\nHowever, we need to consider the fact that the question asks for the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, not the total number of times. Therefore, the correct answer is the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, which is 1. \n\nSo, the final answer is 1.5, but since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

    "answer": "Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.\nHe is stringing 5 racquets with polyester string, so those will take 5 polyester string jobs * 22 minutes per polyester string job = <<5*22=110>>110 minutes.\nHe has 4 hybrid string jobs, so those will take 4 hybrid string jobs * 18 minutes per hybrid job = <<4*18=72>>72 minutes.\nSo Andy should finish stringing all the racquets in 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = <<45+110+72=227>>227 minutes.\n#### 227"

Let's call the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday \"x\". Then, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is x - 4.\n\nOn Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.\n\nWe are also given that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday:\n\nSaturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread and (x - 4) boxes of apple pie\nSunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread and x boxes of apple pie\n\nThe total number of boxes of gingerbread sold over the two days is 10 + 15 = 25.\nThe total number of boxes of apple pie sold over the two days is (x - 4) + x = 2x - 4.\n\nSince the total number of boxes of gingerbread sold is 25, we can set up the equation: 25 = 10 + 15\nThis equation is true, so we can move on to the next step.\n\nThe total number of boxes of apple pie sold is 2x - 4. We know that the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is 15, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 4 = 15\nSolving for x, we get: 2x = 19, x = 9.5\n\nNow that we know the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday, we can calculate the total number of boxes of apple pie sold over the two days: 2x - 4 = 2(9.5) - 4 = 15\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money earned from gingerbread and apple pie:\n\nGingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150\nApple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225\n\nTotal amount earned: $150 + $225 = $375\n\nHowever, we need to calculate the total amount earned over the two days, not just the total number of boxes sold. Since the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday is 10, and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 5 less than on Sunday, we can calculate the total number of boxes sold on Saturday: 10 + (9.5 - 4) = 15.5\n\nThe total number of boxes sold on Saturday is 15.5, and the total number of boxes sold on Sunday is 25. The total number of boxes sold over the two days is 15.5 + 25 = 40.5\n\nSince the total number of boxes sold is 40.5, and the total amount earned is $375, we can calculate the average price per box: $375 / 40.5 = $9.25\n\nHowever, this is not the correct approach. We should calculate the total amount earned for each day and then add them together.\n\nOn Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and (9.5 - 4) = 5.5 boxes of apple pie. The total amount earned on Saturday is: 10 * $6 + 5.5 * $15 = $60 + $82.50 = $142.50\n\nOn Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 9.5 boxes of apple pie.

We know that she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so we can calculate the time it takes her to saute 90 shrimp. \n\nSince 90 shrimp is three times 30 shrimp, it will take her three times as long to saute 90 shrimp as it takes her to saute 30 shrimp.

    "raw": "<think> Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans he gets is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.\n2. Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job, so he lost $25,000 * 4 = $100,000 in income while in college.\n3. His college degree triples his income, so his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.\n4. To find out how long it takes Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount he needs to earn, which is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.\n5. Since Jim's new income is $75,000 per year, we can divide the total amount he needs to earn by his new income to find out how many years it will take him to earn it: $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer, because Jim already spent 4 years in college, so we need to add the 4 years he spent in college to the 4 years it takes him to earn the money. Therefore, the total number of years is 4 (college) + 4 (earning money) = 8 years.\n\nBut wait, we are not done yet! We need to consider the fact that Jim earns $75,000 per year, and he earns interest on his savings. Let's assume the interest rate is 5% per year. We can use the formula for compound interest to calculate the total amount he earns in 4 years:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^n\n\nwhere A is the total amount, P is the principal (initial) amount, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, P = $75,000, r = 0.05, and n = 4. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nA = $75,000(1 + 0.05)^4\nA \u2248 $99,610.51\n\nSo, in 4 years, Jim earns approximately $99,610.51. This means that he earns more than the $75,000 he needs to earn each year, so he will pay off the loans and the lost income in less than 4 years.\n\nLet's recalculate the number of years it takes him to earn the money:\n\n$300,000 / $99,610.51 \u2248 3.01 years\n\nSince Jim already spent 4 years in college, we add the 3.01 years it takes him to earn the money to the 4 years he spent in college:\n\n4 (college) + 3.01 (earning money) \u2248 7.01 years\n\nHowever, we are not done yet! We need to consider the fact that Jim earns interest on his savings, so we need to recalculate the number of years it takes him to earn the money.\n\nLet's use the formula for compound interest again:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^n\n\nWe know that A = $300,000, P = $75,000, and r = 0.05. We want to find n. We can rearrange the formula to solve for n:\n\nn = ln(A/P) / ln(1 + r)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nn \u2248 ln($300,000 / $75,000) / ln(1 + 0.05)\nn \u2248 4.01\n\nSo, it takes Jim approximately 4.01 years to earn the money. Since he already spent 4 years in college, we add the 4.01 years it takes him to earn the money to the 4 years he spent in college:\n\n4 (college) + 4.01 (earning money) \u2248 8.01 years\n\nHowever, we are not done yet!

Since he already spent 4 years in college,",
    "answer": "His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year\nSo he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year\nHis loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000\nHe lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working\nSo he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000\nThat means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years\n#### 4"

Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings is:\n20% of $100,000 = 0.20 x $100,000 = $20,000\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is:\n40% of $100,000 = 0.40 x $100,000 = $40,000 per year\n\nSince she wants to live on this amount for 20 years, the total amount she needs to save is:\n$40,000 x 20 = $800,000\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save this amount. We can use the formula:\nYears = Total Amount / Annual Savings\nYears = $800,000 / $20,000\nYears = 40\n\nHowever, this is the number of years she needs to work to save the total amount, but we need to consider that she is already working and saving.

    "raw": "<think> Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many snowballs Jay builds per minute. Since he builds 20 snowballs in an hour, we can divide 20 by 60 to get the number of snowballs he builds per minute: 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find out how many snowballs melt per minute, we can divide 2 by 15: 2/15 snowballs per minute.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per minute. This is the number of snowballs he builds per minute minus the number of snowballs that melt per minute: 1/3 - 2/15. To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So, we can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 snowballs per minute.\n\nSince Jay needs 60 snowballs, and he builds 3/15 snowballs per minute, we can set up a proportion to find out how many minutes it will take him to build 60 snowballs. Let x be the number of minutes it takes. Then, (3/15)x = 60.\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15/3 to get x = 60 * (15/3) = 300 minutes.\n\nHowever, this is the time it would take if no snowballs melted. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to add the time it takes for 2 snowballs to melt to the total time. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we can divide 300 by 15 to get the number of 15-minute intervals: 300/15 = 20. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we can multiply 20 by 2 to get the total number of snowballs that melt: 20 * 2 = 40 snowballs.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct approach. We should instead find the time it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs, considering the melting rate. Let's recalculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per minute: 1/3 - 2/15 = (5-4)/15 = 1/15 snowballs per minute.\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion to find out how many minutes it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs: (1/15)x = 60.\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15 to get x = 60 * 15 = 900 minutes.\n\nHowever, this is the time it would take if no snowballs melted.

    "raw": "<think>\n\nLet's break this problem down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can calculate this as follows:\n\nNumber of fish with red stripes = Total number of fish \u00d7 (1/3)\n= 66 \u00d7 (1/3)\n= 22\n\nNext, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. This is the remaining two-thirds of the fish:\n\nNumber of fish without red stripes = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes\n= 66 - 22\n= 44\n\nNow, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes among the remaining fish. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we can calculate this as follows:\n\nNumber of fish with blue stripes = Number of fish without red stripes \u00d7 (5/11)\n= 44 \u00d7 (5/11)\n= 20\n\nHowever, we need to find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes. To do this, we need to add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes. But, we need to be careful not to double-count the fish that have both red and blue stripes.\n\nSince we don't have information about the number of fish that have both red and blue stripes, we can't simply add the two numbers. However, we can use the fact that the total number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes is equal to the total number of fish minus the number of fish that have neither red nor blue stripes.\n\nLet's denote the number of fish that have both red and blue stripes as x. Then, the number of fish that have neither red nor blue stripes is:\n\nNumber of fish with neither red nor blue stripes = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes - Number of fish with blue stripes + x\n= 66 - 22 - 20 + x\n= 24 + x\n\nSince the number of fish that have neither red nor blue stripes is equal to the total number of fish minus the number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we can set up the following equation:\n\nTotal number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes - Number of fish with blue stripes + x = Number of fish with neither red nor blue stripes\n66 - 22 - 20 + x = 24 + x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n24 = 24\n\nThis equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of fish that have both red and blue stripes is not fixed. However, we can still find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes by adding the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:\n\nTotal number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes\n= 22 + 20\n= 42\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer, as we are asked to find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, including those that have both. To find this, we need to add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes, and then subtract the number of fish that have both red and blue stripes. Since we don't know the exact number of fish that have both, we can't find the exact answer. However, we can express the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes as:\n\nTotal number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes - Number of fish with both red and blue stripes\n= 22 + 20 - x\n\nSince we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact answer. However, we can express the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes as an inequality:\n\n22 + 20 - x \u2264 Total number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes \u2264 22 + 20\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n42 - x \u2264 Total number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes \u2264 42\n\nSince we are asked to find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we can conclude that the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes is at least 42 and at most 42.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer, as we are asked to find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, including those that have both.

We know that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

    "answer": "The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches\nThat means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans\nWith 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there\nSo that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red\nSo his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36\n#### 36"

    "answer": "The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320\nSo he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80\nThe mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150\nSo in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230\n#### 230"

    "raw": "<think> Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that C + W = 20, since there are 20 animals in total. We also know that 2C + 2W = 70, since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 2 legs, and together they have 70 legs. We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2, getting C + W = 35. Now we have two equations: C + W = 20 and C + W = 35. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get 0 = 15, which is a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption that the two equations are consistent is incorrect. However, we can try to find the solution by solving the system of equations. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get C = 15. This means that there are 15 chickens. </think>\n\n<answer> 15 </answer>",
    "answer": "Let C be the number of chickens.\nThere are 20-C cows.\nThe cows have 4*(20-C) legs.\nThe cows have 2C legs.\nThe total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.\n2C+80-4C=70\n2C=10\nC=<<5=5>>5\n#### 5"

    "raw": "<think> \nTo find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply 7 by 8 to get the total number of slices. \n7 * 8 = 56 slices in total. \nNow, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). \n56 / 4 = 14 slices per person. \n</think>\n\n<answer> 14 </answer>",
    "answer": "There are 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices in total.\nThere are 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4 people in total.\nThey can each have 56/4=<<56/4=14>>14 slices.\n#### 14"
