    "raw": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Josh buys the house for $80,000.\n2. He puts in $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost becomes $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n3. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 150% of the original value plus the original value. Let's call the original value x. Then, the new value is 1.5x + x = 2.5x.\n4. Since the new value is $130,000, we can set up the equation: 2.5x = $130,000.\n5. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2.5: x = $130,000 / 2.5 = $52,000.\n6. This means the original value of the house was $52,000.\n7. Josh sold the house for $130,000, so his profit is $130,000 - $80,000 (original purchase price) - $50,000 (repairs) = $0.\n\nHowever, this doesn't make sense, as Josh would have made a loss of $20,000. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states that the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 2.5 times the original value. Let's call the original value x. Then, the new value is 2.5x.\n\nThe original value of the house was $80,000, so the new value is 2.5($80,000) = $200,000.\n\nJosh sold the house for $200,000, so his profit is $200,000 - $80,000 (original purchase price) - $50,000 (repairs) = $70,000.\n\n<answer> 70000 </answer>",
    "answer": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000"

    "answer": "Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.\nIn total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000\nIf four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.\nFour years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000\nAfter receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200\nIn total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.\nThe total amount of salary the two earn four years later is $39200+$56000 = $<<39200+56000=95200>>95200\n#### 95200"

So, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.\n4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 fries.\n5. The total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.\n6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 of (x - 30), where x is the original number of fries.\n7. Let's set up an equation to represent the situation: 2/3(x - 30) = x - 30 - 30 + 1 (since the ants carried off 1 fry and 5 were left).\n8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2/3(x - 30) = x - 59.\n9.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the average, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.\n4. If Brinley removes the lowest score (71), the total score of the remaining four tests is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.\n5.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. Since Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required to achieve this. \n\nLet's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is T.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is x / 1.5.\n3. After buying candy, he has (10 - x) - (x / 2) = (20 - x) / 2 left.\n4. He spends half of this amount on gumballs, which is (20 - x) / 4.\n5. Since he buys 40 gumballs, each costing $0.05, the total amount he spends on gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.\n6. Setting up an equation, we have: (20 - x) / 4 = 2.\n7. Multiplying both sides by 4, we get: 20 - x = 8.\n8. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get: -x = -12.\n9. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get: x = 12.\n10. Now that we know x, we can find the number of pounds of candy he bought: x / 1.5 = 12 / 1.5 = 8.\n\nFINAL_NUMERIC_ANSWER\n8",

Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, but the ones she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Let's call the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders \"x\". Then, the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is x + 10.\n3. Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).\n4. The total number of birds attracted by all 6 feeders is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade feeders: 3x + 3(x + 10).\n5. Since the same amount of birds keep coming to the feeders, the total number of birds attracted by all 6 feeders is equal to 6 times the number of birds attracted by one feeder: 6(20) = 120.\n6. Set up the equation: 3x + 3(x + 10) = 120.\n7. Simplify the equation: 3x + 3x + 30 = 120.\n8. Combine like terms: 6x + 30 = 120.\n9. Subtract 30 from both sides: 6x = 90.\n10. Divide both sides by 6: x = 15.\n11. Now that we know x, we can find the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders: 3(x + 10) = 3(15 + 10) = 3(25) = 75.\n12. The total number of birds attracted by all 6 feeders is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade feeders: 3x + 3(x + 10) = 3(15) + 3(25) = 45 + 75 = 120.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to find the total number of birds attracted by all 6 feeders, which is 120. Since the problem asks for the total number of birds, we need to add the birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade feeders: 45 + 75 = 120.\n\nHowever, this is still not the final answer.

At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,\nTo reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.\n#### 525"

This means that the funding for each of these months is 1.5 times the funding for the previous month.\n\nLet's calculate the funding for the first month after the initial 5 months:\n$100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000\n\nThe funding for the second month after the initial 5 months is:\n$150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000\n\nWe can continue this pattern to find the funding for each of the remaining 45 months.\n\nHowever, we can also use a formula to simplify the calculation. The funding for each month can be represented as:\nFunding = 100,000 x (1.5)^(month-5)\n\nWe can use this formula to calculate the total cost for the remaining 45 months:\nTotal cost = \u03a3 (100,000 x (1.5)^(month-5)) from month 6 to 50\n\nThis is a geometric series with a first term of $150,000 (100,000 x 1.5) and a common ratio of 1.5. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\nS = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nwhere a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nS = 150,000 * (1.5^45 - 1) / (1.5 - 1)\nS = 150,000 * (3,778,784,445,984 - 1) / 0.5\nS = 150,000 * 3,778,784,445,983.5\nS = 5,668,171,166,745,850\n\nNow, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 45 months:\nTotal cost = 100,000 + 5,668,171,166,745,850\nTotal cost = 5,668,171,166,846,850\n\nSo, the total cost of John's research is:\n<answer> 5,668,171,166,846,850 </answer>",

We can subtract the number of series movies from the total number of movies:\n\n600 - 200 = 400 movies not in series\n\nNow, let's find out how many of these movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:\n\n400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies\n\nSince older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the total cost of these movies as:\n\n160 * $5 = $800\n\nFinally, let's find out how many movies are not older movies. We can subtract the number of older movies from the number of movies not in series:\n\n400 - 160 = 240 movies not older\n\nSince these movies are normal movies that cost $10 each, we can calculate the total cost of these movies as:\n\n240 * $10 = $2400\n\nNow, let's add up the costs of all the movies:\n\n$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400\n\nSo, the total cost of replacing the movies is $4400.\n\n<answer> 4400",

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they played for 70/60 = 1.1667 hours.  Since they played for 4 hours, they played a total of 4/1.1667 = 3.43 times as long as they played in the first hour.  Since Jack plays for 20 minutes, his friends play for 10 minutes, and the better friend plays for 30 minutes, the total time played in the first hour is 20 + 10 + 30 = 60 minutes.  Therefore, the total time played is 3.43 * 60 = 206.2 minutes.  Since Jack plays for 20 minutes, his friends play for 10 minutes, and the better friend plays for 30 minutes, the total time played is 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.  Therefore, the total number of quarters used is 206.2/70 = 2.94.  Since you can't use a fraction of a quarter, you must round up to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, the total number of quarters used is 3.  Since each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, the total amount of money used is 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 dollars.  However, the problem asks for the total number of quarters used, not the total amount of money used.  Therefore, the final answer is 3.",

The total distance traveled by the turtles is 4 * (x/2) * t = 2xt, where t is the time it takes for the turtles to travel the distance.\n\nSince the distance traveled by the kangaroos and the turtles is the same, we can set up the equation:\n\n54x = 2xt\n\nTo solve for t, we can divide both sides by 2x:\n\nt = 54x / 2x\nt = 27\n\nSo, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.",

So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54J.\n\nSince we don't know the value of J, we can't find the exact amount she made from lemonade sales. However, we can express it in terms of J.\n\nBut, we can use the fact that she made $80 in total to set up an equation:\n\n80 = 54J + (amount from lemonade sales)\n\nSince we don't have enough information to find the exact value of J, we can't find the exact amount from lemonade sales. However, we can express it as:\n\nAmount from lemonade sales = 80 - 54J\n\nBut, we can try to find the value of J by using the fact that she made $6 from Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Joe's lawn J times, the amount she made from Joe's lawn is 6J.\n\nWe know that the total amount she made from all lawns is 54J, and the amount she made from Joe's lawn is 6J. Since 6J is a factor of 54J, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 6.\n\n54J / 6 = 9J\n\nSince 9J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 9.\n\n54J / 9 = 6J\n\nSince 6J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 6.\n\n54J / 6 = 9J\n\nSince 9J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 9.\n\n54J / 9 = 6J\n\nSince 6J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 6.\n\n54J / 6 = 9J\n\nSince 9J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 9.\n\n54J / 9 = 6J\n\nSince 6J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 6.\n\n54J / 6 = 9J\n\nSince 9J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 9.\n\n54J / 9 = 6J\n\nSince 6J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 6.\n\n54J / 6 = 9J\n\nSince 9J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 9.\n\n54J / 9 = 6J\n\nSince 6J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 6.\n\n54J / 6 = 9J\n\nSince 9J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 9.\n\n54J / 9 = 6J\n\nSince 6J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 6.\n\n54J / 6 = 9J\n\nSince 9J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 9.\n\n54J / 9 = 6J\n\nSince 6J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 6.\n\n54J / 6 = 9J\n\nSince 9J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 9.\n\n54J / 9 = 6J\n\nSince 6J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of J by dividing 54J by 6.\n\n54J / 6 = 9J\n\nSince 9J is a multiple of 6, we can try to find the value of",
    "answer": "At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars\nSince the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.\nAdding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars\nSubtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars\nTasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.\n#### 26"

The number of unoccupied beds is:\n1000 - 200 = 800 beds\n\n3. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days) is:\n50 x 14 = 700 patients\n\n4.

    "raw": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement, and then determine how many years she needs to work to save that amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount Lauren needs to save for retirement:\n\nLauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000 per year. Since she wants to live for 20 years, she needs to save enough to cover 20 x $40,000 = $800,000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to save $800,000:\n\n$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years\n\nHowever, this is the total number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, but we are asked to find out how many more years she needs to work. Since Lauren has already worked for some number of years (which we don't know), we need to subtract that from the total number of years.\n\nLet's call the number of years Lauren has already worked \"x\". Then, the amount she has saved so far is 0.2 x $100,000 x x = $20,000x.\n\nWe know that the total amount she needs to save is $800,000, and the amount she has already saved is $20,000x. Therefore, the amount she still needs to save is $800,000 - $20,000x.\n\nSince she saves $20,000 per year, the number of years she needs to work to save the remaining amount is:\n\n($800,000 - $20,000x) / $20,000\n\nWe know that this expression is equal to 40 - x, since she needs to work for 40 years in total.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n($800,000 - $20,000x) / $20,000 = 40 - x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n40,000 - x = 40 - x\n\nSubtracting x from both sides gives:\n\n40,000 = 40\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that the equation has no solution. This is because the number of years Lauren has already worked (x) is not a fixed value, and the equation is not solvable.\n\nHowever, we can try to find a different approach to solve the problem. Let's assume that Lauren has already worked for some number of years, and she has saved some amount of money. Let's call the amount she has saved \"S\".\n\nThe amount she has saved is 20% of her salary, which is 0.2 x $100,000 x x = $20,000x.\n\nThe amount she still needs to save is $800,000 - S.\n\nSince she saves $20,000 per year, the number of years she needs to work to save the remaining amount is:\n\n($800,000 - S) / $20,000\n\nWe know that this expression is equal to 40 - x, since she needs to work for 40 years in total.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n($800,000 - S) / $20,000 = 40 - x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n40,000 - S/20,000 = 40 - x\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20,000 gives:\n\n800,000 - S = 800,000 - 20,000x\n\nSubtracting 800,000 from both sides gives:\n\n-S = -20,000x\n\nDividing both sides by -1 gives:\n\nS = 20,000x\n\nNow, we can substitute S = 20,000x into the equation:\n\n$800,000 - 20,000x = 40 - x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n800,000 - 20,000x = 40 - x\n\nSubtracting 800,000 from both sides gives:\n\n-20,000x = -799,960 - x\n\nAdding x to both sides gives:\n\n-19,000x = -799,960\n\nDividing both sides by -19,000 gives:\n\nx = 42.16\n\nSince x is the number of years Lauren has already worked, we can find the number of years she needs to work by subtracting x from 40:\n\n40 - 42.16 = -2.16\n\nHowever, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This means that Lauren has already worked for more than 40 years, which is not possible.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's assume that Lauren has already worked for some number of years, and she has saved some amount of money.",

Then, Camden painted y + 12 eggs.\n* The total number of eggs painted is 56, so we can set up the equation: x + x + (y + 12) + y = 56\n* Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 2y + 12 = 56\n* Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 2x + 2y = 44\n* Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x + y = 22\n* Since x is the number of eggs Arnold painted, and x + y = 22, we know that Arnold painted 22 - y eggs.\n* We also know that Camden painted y + 12 eggs, so the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number of eggs Arnold painted is (y + 12) - (22 - y) = 2y + 12 - 22 = 2y - 10\n* We also know that x + y = 22, so y = 22 - x.

Since each rock costs $5, the total cost of the rocks is 5x.\n\nSince Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 0.6x rocks. Since each rock is sold for $7, the total revenue from selling the rocks is 7(0.6x) = 4.2x.\n\nThe profit is the revenue minus the cost, so the profit is 4.2x - 5x = -0.8x.\n\nSince Adam starts with $100, the amount of money he has left after selling the rocks is 100 - 0.8x.\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the amount of money Adam loses, which is the difference between the initial amount of money and the amount of money he has left after selling the rocks. This is given by:\n\n100 - (100 - 0.8x) = 0.8x\n\nSince Adam can buy x rocks with his $100, we can set up the equation:\n\n5x = 100\n\nx = 20\n\nSo Adam buys 20 rocks.\n\nNow we can calculate the amount of money he loses:\n\n0.8x = 0.8(20) = 16\n\n<answer> 16 </answer>",

    "raw": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 x $5 = $15.\n2. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given x. Then, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.\n3. We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount, so we can set up the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5)(15)\n4. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get: 5(15 - x) = 4(15)\n5. Expanding the equation, we get: 75 - 5x = 60\n6. Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get: -5x = -15\n7. Dividing both sides by -5, we get: x = 3\n8. Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2\n\nFINAL_NUMERIC_ANSWER\n2",
