The original value of the house was $80,000, and Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%.  This means the value of the house after the repairs is 2.5 times the original value, or 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.\n\nStep 2:  To find the profit, we need to subtract the original cost of the house from the new value of the house.  The original cost of the house was $80,000, and the new value of the house is $200,000.  Therefore, the profit is $200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000.\n\nStep 3:  However, we also need to consider the $50,000 that Josh put into repairs.  This is an additional cost that Josh incurred, so we need to subtract it from the profit.  The profit is $120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000.\n\n<answer>70000</answer>",

Since it is three-fifths water, the amount of water is (3/5)\u00d715 = 9 liters.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink. This is the sum of the water in the orange drink and the water in the pineapple drink, which is 20/3 + 9 = 43/3 liters.\n\nStep 4: Since one liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the total amount of water minus the amount of water spilled, which is 43/3 - 1 = 40/3 liters.\n\nStep 5: To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the fraction of the total mixture that is water.

I need to subtract the delivery fee and tip from the final bill to find the original cost of the groceries.  However, I also need to account for the 25% fee that was added to the original cost of the groceries.  I can represent the original cost of the groceries as x.  The 25% fee is 0.25x, and the delivery fee is $3.00, and the tip is $4.00.  The final bill is the sum of the original cost of the groceries, the 25% fee, the delivery fee, and the tip.  So, the equation is x + 0.25x + 3 + 4 = 40.\n\nStep 2: Combine like terms to simplify the equation.  x + 0.25x = 1.25x.  So, the equation becomes 1.25x + 7 = 40.\n\nStep 3: Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable.  1.25x = 33.\n\nStep 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 1.25 to solve for x.  x = 26.4.\n\nStep 5: Now that I know the original cost of the groceries, I can calculate the final price of the groceries by adding the 25% fee, delivery fee, and tip to the original cost.

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can solve for Lylah's salary: 40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary => Lylah's salary = 40000 / 1.3 = 3076.92.\nStep 2:  Next, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary: Adrien's new salary = 40000 + (0.4 * 40000) = 40000 + 16000 = 56000.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we can calculate her new salary: Lylah's new salary = 3076.92 + (0.4 * 3076.92) = 3076.92 + 1230.77 = 4307.69.\nStep 4:  Finally, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries: Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary = 56000 + 4307.69 = 60307.69.\n\n<answer>60307.69</answer>",

Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters.\nStep 3:  Since the coffee is cooled by 13 degrees by each ice cube, we can assume that the weakening effect is directly proportional to the cooling effect. Therefore, the weakening effect of one ice cube is 12 milliliters per 13 degrees.\nStep 4:  To find the weakening effect of one degree, we can divide the weakening effect of one ice cube by the cooling effect of one ice cube: 12 milliliters / 13 degrees = 0.923 milliliters per degree.\nStep 5:  Now, we can calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes that cool the coffee by 65 degrees: 0.923 milliliters/degree \u00d7 65 degrees = 60 milliliters.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to consider the weakening effect of the added cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.\nStep 7:  To find the total weakening effect, we add the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream: 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters.\nStep 8:  Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.\n\n<answer>75</answer>",

The cost of 5 pounds of butter at half off is 5 x $2.00 = $10.00.\n\nStep 4: The cost of 1 pound of butter is $4.00, so the cost of the remaining 1 pound of butter is $4.00.\n\nStep 5: To find the total cost, we add the cost of 5 pounds of butter at half off and the cost of 1 pound of butter at full price. The total cost is $10.00 + $4.00 = $14.00.\n\n<answer>$14.00</answer>",

This is the difference between her annual salary and her annual expenses in retirement, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000.\n\nStep 4: Since Lauren plans to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement. This is $60,000 x 20 = $1,200,000.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save $1,200,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year. This is $1,200,000 / $20,000 = 60 years.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer because it doesn't take into account that Lauren is already working and has been saving for some time. We need to calculate how many years she has already worked and saved.\n\nStep 6: Let's assume Lauren has been working for x years. In that case, she has saved x x $20,000 = $20,000x.\n\nStep 7: Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation. The total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement is $1,200,000, and she has already saved $20,000x. So, the equation is $20,000x + (number of years she still needs to work) x $20,000 = $1,200,000.\n\nStep 8: We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by $20,000. This gives us x + (number of years she still needs to work) = 60.\n\nStep 9: Since Lauren plans to work for 20 years, we can substitute 20 for (number of years she still needs to work) in the equation.

The total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement is $1,200,000, and she has already saved $20,000x. So, the equation is $20,000x + (number of years she still needs to work) x $20,000 = $1,200,000.\n\nStep 14: We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by $20,000.

The total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement is $1,200,000, and she has already saved $20,000x. So, the equation is $20,000x + (number of years she still needs to work) x $20,000 = $1,200,000.\n\nStep 20: We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by $20,000.

Let x be the number of 15-minute intervals. The number of snowballs Jay builds is (1/3)x, and the number of snowballs that melt is (2/3)x. We want the difference between the number of snowballs built and the number of snowballs melted to be 60.\n\nStep 4: The equation is (1/3)x - (2/3)x = 60.\n\nStep 5: Simplifying the equation, we get -(1/3)x = 60.\n\nStep 6: Multiplying both sides by -3, we get x = -180.\n\nStep 7: However, the number of intervals cannot be negative, so we need to re-evaluate our approach.\n\nStep 8: Let's re-evaluate the problem.

So, he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.\n\nStep 2: Next, let's calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and Madeline. This is 6 (Madeline's grapes) + 30 (brother's grapes) = 36 grapes.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's determine how many grapes were left after Madeline's brother used his grapes. The total number of grapes at the beginning is unknown, so let's call it x. The number of grapes left is x - 36.\n\nStep 4: Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's set up an equation to find the total number of grapes at the beginning. The number of grapes left after Madeline's brother used his grapes (x - 36) plus the number of grapes used by their mother (48) is equal to the total number of grapes at the beginning (x). So, the equation is x - 36 + 48 = x.\n\nStep 6: Simplify the equation. x - 36 + 48 = x becomes x + 12 = x.\n\nStep 7: Subtract x from both sides of the equation to isolate the variable. x + 12 - x = x - x becomes 12 = 0.\n\nStep 8: This is a contradiction, as 12 cannot equal 0. This means that the initial assumption that the number of grapes left after Madeline's brother used his grapes is x - 36 is incorrect.\n\nStep 9: Let's re-examine the problem. The number of grapes left after Madeline's brother used his grapes is actually x - 36, and their mother used 48 grapes to make 4 pies. The number of grapes left after their mother used her grapes is x - 36 - 48.\n\nStep 10: The number of grapes left after their mother used her grapes is also equal to the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and Madeline, which is 36. So, we can set up the equation x - 36 - 48 = 36.\n\nStep 11: Simplify the equation. x - 84 = 36.\n\nStep 12: Add 84 to both sides of the equation to isolate the variable. x - 84 + 84 = 36 + 84 becomes x = 120.\n\n<answer>120</answer>",
