The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the profit will be 2.5% of $5,000. \n\nTo calculate 2.5% of $5,000, we multiply $5,000 by 0.025. \n\n$5,000 * 0.025 = $125 \n\nSo, the potential profit for the jewelry option is $125.\n\nNext, let's calculate the potential profit for the electronic gadgets option.

    "raw": "<think> \nTo solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered by each train on the first day and the distance covered by each train on the second day.\n\nOn the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can simply add the distances covered by each train to find the total distance covered on the first day. However, we are not given the individual distances covered by each train on the first day, so we cannot find the individual distances covered by each train on the first day.\n\nOn the second day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered by each train to find the total distance covered on the second day. However, we are not given the individual distances covered by each train on the second day, so we cannot find the individual distances covered by each train on the second day.\n\nSince we are not given the individual distances covered by each train on either day, we cannot find the individual distances covered by each train in the two days.\n\nHowever, we can find the total distance covered by both trains in the two days. On the first day, they travel a total of 80 + 80 = 160 miles. On the second day, they travel a total of 150 + 150 = 300 miles. Therefore, the total distance covered by both trains in the two days is 160 + 300 = 460 miles.\n\nSince we are not given any information about the individual distances covered by each train, we cannot find the individual distances covered by each train in the two days. However, we can find the total distance covered by both trains in the two days, which is 460 miles.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the distance covered by each train in the two days. Since we cannot find the individual distances covered by each train, we cannot provide a final answer.\n\nBut, we can find the distance covered by each train in the two days if we assume that both trains travel the same distance on the first day and the second day. Let's assume that both trains travel x miles on the first day and y miles on the second day. Then, the total distance covered by both trains in the two days is 2x + 2y = 460.\n\nWe know that x + y = 80 (since they travel 80 miles on the first day) and y = 150 (since they travel 150 miles on the second day). We can substitute y = 150 into the equation x + y = 80 to get x + 150 = 80, which gives x = -70. However, this is not possible since distance cannot be negative.\n\nLet's try another approach. We know that the total distance covered by both trains in the two days is 460 miles. We also know that they travel 80 miles on the first day and 150 miles on the second day. Let's assume that the first train travels x miles on the first day and y miles on the second day. Then, the second train travels (80 - x) miles on the first day and (150 - y) miles on the second day.\n\nThe total distance covered by both trains in the two days is 2x + 2y = 460. We can also write an equation for the total distance covered by the first train: x + y = 80. We can write an equation for the total distance covered by the second train: (80 - x) + (150 - y) = 230.\n\nWe can solve the system of equations x + y = 80 and (80 - x) + (150 - y) = 230. Subtract",
    "answer": "On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.\nThey also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.\nThe combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles\nThe average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train\n#### 230"

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We can write an equation based on the given information: G = S + 30.

So the total amount of money he got from selling the lego sets is 15*x + 160 + 5 = 15*x + 165. But we know that he got this money from selling the lego sets, so it's also equal to 15*x. Thus, 15*x = 15*x + 165. Subtracting 15*x from both sides, we get 0 = 165. This is a contradiction, so the initial assumption that John sells x lego sets must be wrong. Let's try another approach.

Dividing both sides by 15, we get x = 24. So John sold 24 lego sets. Since he started with 13 lego sets, he still has 13 - 24 = -11 lego sets.

He runs 60 miles a week. \n\nNext, let's calculate the total time John spends running in a week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as much, which is 3/2 = 1.5 hours. So, the total time he spends running in a week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.\n\nNow, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance he runs in a week by the total time he spends running in a week. Speed = Distance / Time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. \n\nHowever, we need to find the speed for each day. Since John runs 3 hours on the first day, his speed on the first day is 60 miles / 3 hours = 20 miles per hour. On the other two days, he runs for 1.5 hours, so his speed on those days is 60 miles / 1.5 hours = 40 miles per hour.\n\nSo, John's speed is 20 miles per hour on the first day and 40 miles per hour on the other two days. \n\nBut the question asks for the speed, not the speed for each day. Therefore, we need to find the average speed for the three days. \n\nThe average speed is (20 + 40 + 40) / 3 = 100 / 3 = 33.33 miles per hour.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.

We can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost per tie: 200 / 40 = 5. So, John bought 5 blue ties.\n\nSince John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he must have bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.\n\nWe are also told that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means that the cost of a red tie is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie, or $40 * 1.5 = $60.\n\nTo find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per tie: 10 * 60 = 600.\n\nFinally, to find the total amount spent on all ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties: 200 + 600 = 800.\n\nTherefore, John spent a total of $800 on ties. </think>\n\n<answer> 800 </answer>",

Since the company increases the salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years, we can calculate the salary for each year: Year 1: $600 Year 2: $600 * 1.10 = $660 Year 3: $660 * 1.10 = $726 Year 4: $726 * 1.10 = $798.60 Year 5: $798.60 * 1.10 = $877.46 After 5 years, Sylvie's salary is $877.46. Now, let's calculate her salary for the next 3 years. Since the company increases the salary by 10% every year, we can calculate the salary for each year: Year 6: $877.46 * 1.10 = $965.306 Year 7: $965.306 * 1.10 = $1,065.7366 Year 8: $1,065.7366 * 1.10 = $1,173.20926 The salary for the 8th year is $1,173.21.

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, the rate of water intake is 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per foot. \n\nSince it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the time it takes to row 1 foot is 16 / 20 = 0.8 seconds. \n\nNow, we need to find the total time it takes to row 64 feet to the shore. Since it takes 0.8 seconds to row 1 foot, it will take 64 * 0.8 = 51.2 seconds to row 64 feet. \n\nSince the boat takes on 0.2 liters of water per foot, and it takes 51.2 seconds to row 64 feet, the total amount of water taken on is 0.2 liters/foot * 64 feet = 12.8 liters. \n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the boat takes on water at a rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed, not per foot. So, the correct rate of water intake is 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per 10 feet. \n\nSince it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the time it takes to row 10 feet is 16 / 2 = 8 seconds. \n\nNow, we need to find the total time it takes to row 64 feet to the shore. Since it takes 8 seconds to row 10 feet, it will take 64 / 10 = 6.4 sets of 10 feet. \n\nSince each set of 10 feet takes 8 seconds, the total time to row 64 feet is 6.4 * 8 = 51.2 seconds. \n\nThe boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, so for 6.4 sets of 10 feet, it will take on 6.4 * 2 = 12.8 liters of water. \n\nHowever, this is still not the correct answer.

Let's call the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo \"y\". Then, Brittany's phone can hold 50y photographs. * We are also given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs, we can set up the equation 6x = 1800. Solving for x, we get x = 300. This means that Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. * Now, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50y photographs, and we also know that it can hold 300 photographs. So, we can set up the equation 50y = 300. Solving for y, we get y = 6. This means that there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. However, the problem asks for the number of ducks, not birds. Since the problem doesn't specify that the photograph only contains ducks, we can't assume that all 6 birds are ducks. However, we can assume that the number of ducks is at least 6, since the problem doesn't provide any information that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, the minimum number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6. However, since the problem asks for the number of ducks, we should consider the possibility that the photograph contains more than 6 ducks. Since the problem doesn't provide any information that would suggest otherwise, we can assume that the photograph contains the maximum number of ducks possible, which is 6. Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6. However, this is not the final answer, since the problem asks for the number of ducks, not the minimum number of ducks. To find the final answer, we need to consider the fact that the problem states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 300/50 = 6. However, this is the number of birds, not ducks. Since the problem asks for the number of ducks, we need to find the number of ducks that can be seen in the photograph. Let's call the number of ducks \"d\". We know that the number of birds is 6, and we also know that the number of birds is equal to the number of ducks plus some other birds. Let's call the number of other birds \"b\". Then, we can set up the equation 6 = d + b. We also know that the number of birds is 6, and we know that the number of birds is equal to the number of ducks plus some other birds. Let's call the number of other birds \"b\". Then, we can set up the equation 6 = d + b.

This means that the pigeons must have eaten the remaining 7 fries, leaving 0 fries.\n* A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 0 * 2/3 = 0 fries.\n* Ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 0 - 1 = -1 fries. However, we can't have a negative number of fries, so this means that the ants ate the last fry. This is not possible, as there were no fries left. Let's re-evaluate the situation: the raccoon stole 0 fries, and the ants ate 1 fry. This means that there must have been 1 fry left after the raccoon stole 2/3 of the fries. Since the raccoon stole 2/3 of the fries, the remaining 1/3 of the fries is 1.\n* Now, let's find the total number of fries that were left after the seagull ate. We know that the raccoon stole 2/3 of the fries, and 1/3 of the fries remained. Since 1 fry is 1/3 of the total fries, the total number of fries is 1 / (1/3) = 3.\n* However, this is not the total number of fries that Dave bought. We need to add the fries that Dave ate, the seagull ate, and the pigeons ate. Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 9 fries. So, the total number of fries that were eaten is 14 + 7 + 9 = 30.\n* The total number of fries that Dave bought is the sum of the fries that were eaten and the fries that were left. We know that 3 fries were left, so the total number of fries that Dave bought is 30 + 3 = 33.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> 33 </answer>",
    "answer": "Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.\nThe 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.\nThe ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.\nThe raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.\nThus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.\n#### 48"

We know it takes him 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it. Since we're dealing with minutes and seconds, we'll convert the cutting time to minutes. 5 seconds is 5/60 = 1/12 minutes. So, the total time it takes to peel and cut one potato is 1.5 + 1/12 = 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes. Now, we can multiply this time by the total number of potatoes, which is 60. 1.5833 * 60 = 95. \n\nHowever, we need to consider that the problem asks for the total time to peel and cut all the potatoes, not just the time to peel them. Since it takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato, and 1.5833 minutes to peel and cut a potato, we can subtract the peeling time from the total time to get the cutting time. 1.5833 - 1.5 = 0.0833 minutes. Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the cutting time by 60. 0.0833 * 60 = 5 minutes. \n\nSo, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is the time it takes to peel all the potatoes plus the time it takes to cut all the potatoes. 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes to peel all the potatoes, and 5 minutes to cut all the potatoes. 90 + 5 = 95 minutes. However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the peeling time is actually 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes, and the cutting time is 0.0833 * 60 = 5 minutes. The correct answer is the sum of these two times, but we need to add the peeling time and the cutting time together, not multiply them. So, the correct answer is 90 + 5 = 95 minutes.

They get 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 x $0.50 = $10.\n\nSince they made a profit of $25, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit.

The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is $\\frac{3}{6}$, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes.

Since he makes $2000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings would be $2000 * 52 = $104,000.\n\nNow, let's consider the award. The award has a one-time monetary reward of $5000, which is a fixed amount that John will receive. Additionally, the award includes a 5% raise in salary. This means that John's weekly salary will increase by 5% of $2000, which is $100. So, his new weekly salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.\n\nSince the award was given on the first day of the year, John will receive the increased salary for all 52 weeks of the year. Therefore, his total earnings for the year will be the sum of his original earnings and the increased earnings due to the award. \n\nThe increased earnings due to the award will be $2100 * 52 = $109,200. Adding this to his original earnings of $104,000, we get a total of $104,000 + $109,200 = $213,200.\n\nHowever, we also need to add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to this total. Therefore, John's total earnings for the year will be $213,200 + $5000 = $218,200.\n\nSo, John's total earnings for the year will be $218,200. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: <answer> 218200 </answer>",
    "answer": "He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year\nSo the raise is worth .05*104,000=$<<.05*104000=5200>>5200\nSo he makes 104,000+5200=$<<104000+5200=109200>>109,200 from his salary\nSo in total he made 109,200+5,000=$<<109200+5000=114200>>114,200\n#### 114,200"

Since Sara wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40. The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nSara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 for each babysitting job and she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more to afford the jacket and shoes. Since she earns $5 per babysitting job, she needs to babysit $60 / $5 = 12 times to earn the remaining amount.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider that she earns $4 for each lawn mowing job. If she mows the lawn, she will earn $4 per job. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount. \n\nLet's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 12 = $60. Since she needs to earn $60, she can earn the remaining amount by babysitting 12 times.\n\nHowever, we are asked to find out how many times she must mow the lawn. Let's calculate how much she earns from mowing the lawn: $4 * x = $60, where x is the number of times she mows the lawn.

    "answer": "When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.\nEach of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.\nSince each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.\nThere are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.\n#### 192"

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.\n\nWe are given that watching shows was 30% of the total time, and sightseeing was 40% of the total time. Let's represent the total time as x. We can set up the equation: 0.3x = 6 (since 30% of the total time is equal to the time spent watching shows).\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.3: x = 6 / 0.3 = 20.\n\nNow that we know the total time is 20 hours, we can find the time spent sightseeing.

If Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day and reduces the time by 5 hours, he uses it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. So, in 30 days, the total number of hours is 3 * 30 = 90 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day. The energy consumption is 0.9 kilowatts per hour * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatts. \n\nFinally, let's calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 3 hours a day. The energy consumption is 0.9 kilowatts per hour * 3 hours = 2.7 kilowatts.\n\nThe amount of energy saved is the difference between the energy consumption when used for 8 hours a day and when used for 3 hours a day. So, the energy saved is 7.2 - 2.7 = 4.5 kilowatts.\n\nHowever, this is the energy saved per day. To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30. So, the total energy saved is 4.5 * 30 = 135 kilowatts.\n\nTherefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.",
    "answer": "An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.\nAn air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.\nSo, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.\nThat is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.\nHence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.\n#### 81"

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds. He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds. He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds. The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds. Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, the farmer will need to make multiple trips to transport all the feed. To find the number of trips, we can divide the total weight of the feed by the weight the truck can carry: 3400 / 2250 = 1.51. Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed. However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider that the farmer has already made one trip to transport the feed, so the number of trips is 2 - 1 = 1. But we also need to consider that the farmer has already transported 2250 pounds of feed, so we need to find out how many pounds of feed are left to transport. The remaining weight is 3400 - 2250 = 1150 pounds. We can divide this weight by the weight the truck can carry: 1150 / 2250 = 0.51.

We also know that he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. Let's call the number of carrot sticks Matt eats \"x\". Then, the number of cookies he can have is (1/2)x + 2. We are told that this number is equal to 5, so we can set up the equation: (1/2)x + 2 = 5. To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides: (1/2)x = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (1/2)x = 3.

The bottom level has 4 girls, each 64\" tall, so the total height of this level is 4 * 64 = 256\". The next level has 3 girls, each 64\" tall, so the total height of this level is 3 * 64 = 192\". The next level has 2 girls, each 64\" tall, so the total height of this level is 2 * 64 = 128\". The top level has 1 girl, who is 60\" tall. To find the total height of the pyramid, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 536\". Since we want the height in feet, we need to convert the total height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total height in inches by 12: 536 / 12 = 44.67. So, the height of the human pyramid is approximately 44.67 feet.</think>\n\n<answer> 44.67 </answer>",

So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192\" tall\nThe shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid and is 60\" tall so the pyramid is 192+60 = <<252=252>>252\" tall\n12\" are in 1 foot and the pyramid is 252\" tall so it's 252/12 = <<252/12=21>>21 feet tall\n#### 21"

Since he spent 4 hours in 6 of those weeks, we can calculate the total hours spent in those weeks as 4 * 6 = 24 hours. In the remaining 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each, so the total hours spent in those weeks is 5 * 2 = 10 hours. In the last week, he spent 6 hours. Therefore, the total hours spent across the 8 weeks is 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.\n\nSo, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours.",

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference between the two is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. \n\nTo find the percentage by which the oven is off, we can divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%. \n\nThis means that the oven is off by 4% for any recipe. \n\nNow, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set the oven to in order to get 520 degrees.

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can find the number of rotations per mile by dividing 725 by 2, which is 362.5 rotations per mile. \n\nNow, we can multiply the number of rotations per mile by the number of miles Jeremy drives in a month, which is 400 miles. This gives us 362.5 * 400 = 145,000 rotations per month. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many months the tire will last. We can do this by dividing the total number of rotations a tire can undergo (10,440,000) by the number of rotations per month (145,000). This gives us 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months. \n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, we can convert the number of months to years by dividing by 12.

Since each pole has 4 streetlights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the total number of streetlights at each intersection is 6 * 4 = 24. Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of streetlights is 24 * 4 = 96. However, 20 streetlights are not working, so we need to subtract 20 from the total number of streetlights to find the number of functioning streetlights. Therefore, the total number of functioning streetlights is 96 - 20 = 76. \n\nHowever, this problem is not about the number of intersections but the number of poles at each intersection.

To find out how many signatures they need to collect, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of signatures they already have: 20 (Carol's) + 44 (Jennifer's) = 64 signatures.\n\nNow, let's subtract this number from their goal: 100 (goal) - 64 (current signatures) = 36 signatures.\n\nSo, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal. \n\nHowever, they have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they want to reach their goal by the end of the summer. Since they already have 64 signatures, we need to find out how many signatures they can collect in the remaining three weeks. \n\nLet's assume they collect x signatures in the remaining three weeks. Then, the total number of signatures they will have at the end of the summer will be 64 + x.\n\nSince they want to reach 100 signatures, we can set up the equation: 64 + x = 100.\n\nTo solve for x, we subtract 64 from both sides of the equation: x = 100 - 64 = 36.\n\nHowever, this is the number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining three weeks, not the total number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal. Since they already have 64 signatures, they need to collect 36 more signatures in the remaining three weeks, but this is not the answer to the question. The question asks how many signatures they need to collect to reach their goal, not how many they need to collect in the remaining three weeks.\n\nSo, the sisters already have 64 signatures, and they need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

The question asks how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, not how many they need to collect in the remaining three weeks. The answer to the question is actually the number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining three weeks, which is 36. \n\nBut this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is the total number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal, which is 36. \n\nNo, this is not correct.

We can't just divide the total number of animals by 7 without considering the time it takes to groom each type of animal.\n\nLet's calculate the total time it takes to groom each type of animal: \n- Dogs: 8 dogs * 2.5 hours = 20 hours\n- Cats: 5 cats * 0.25 hours = 1.25 hours\n- Birds: 3 birds * 0.25 hours = 0.75 hours\n- Horses: 12 horses * 2.5 hours = 30 hours\n\nThe total time it takes to groom all the animals is: 20 + 1.25 + 0.75 + 30 = 52 hours\n\nSince Melissa has 7 days to groom the animals, we can divide the total time by 7 to find out how many hours she has per day: 52 / 7 = 7.43 hours per day\n\nNow, let's calculate how many animals she can groom per day, considering the time it takes to groom each type of animal. We can start with the animals that take the most time to groom, which are the horses. Since there are 12 horses and it takes 2.5 hours to groom each horse, she can groom 7 / 2.5 = 2.8 horses per day. However, since she can't groom a fraction of a horse, she can groom 2 horses per day.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many dogs she can groom per day. Since she can groom 2 horses per day, and it takes 2.5 hours to groom a horse, she has 7 - 5 = 2 hours left per day. She can groom 2 dogs per day, since it takes 2.5 hours to groom a dog.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many cats and birds she can groom per day. Since she has 2 hours left per day, and it takes 0.25 hours to groom a cat or a bird, she can groom 2 / 0.25 = 8 cats and birds per day. However, she can only groom 2 cats per day, since she has 5 cats in total.

So, we can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.\n\nCombine like terms: 5x = 500.\n\nDivide both sides by 5: x = 100.\n\nNow that we know x, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house, which is x = 100 cases.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of cases needed for the third house, which is actually the value of x, not x/2 or x/4. So, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles. \n\nBut we need to find the number of cases for the third house, which is actually double the first house. So, the third house needs 2*(x/2) = 2*50 = 100 cases of shingles.\n\nHowever, the third house needs double the first house, which is x/2 = 50 cases. So, the third house needs 2*50 = 100 cases of shingles.\n\nThe third house needs double the first house, which is x/2 = 50 cases. So, the third house needs 2*50 = 100 cases of shingles.\n\nThe third house needs double the first house, which is x/2 = 50 cases. So, the third house needs 2*50 = 100 cases of shingles.\n\nThe third house needs double the first house, which is x/2 = 50 cases. So, the third house needs 2*50 = 100 cases of shingles.\n\nThe third house needs double the first house, which is x/2 = 50 cases.

So, the distance they drove is:\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 50 \u00d7 4.5\n\nThe total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

Let's call their driving speed \"d\". Then, their hiking speed is (d - 5) miles per hour.

Then, Ava jumps on E + 8 enemies, collects B + 3 berries, and finishes the level T + 4 seconds later.\n\nThe score for each player is calculated as follows:\n- 10 points for each enemy jumped on\n- 5 points for each berry collected\n- 30 points for each second left on the timer when they finish the level\n\nEmma's score = 10E + 5B + 30(T)\nAva's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)\n\nWe need to find the difference between their scores, which is Ava's score - Emma's score.\n\nAva's score - Emma's score = (10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)) - (10E + 5B + 30T)\n= 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 - 10E - 5B - 30T\n= 80 + 15 - 120\n= -25\n\nHowever, this is the difference in points, and we are asked for the difference in scores. Since the difference in points is negative, it means Ava's score is lower than Emma's score. To find the actual difference in scores, we need to take the absolute value of the difference in points.\n\nThe difference in scores = |Ava's score - Emma's score| = |-25| = 25\n\nHowever, we need to consider the fact that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. This means that Ava loses 4 * 30 = 120 points due to the time difference. So, the actual difference in scores is 25 + 120 = 145.\n\nBut wait, we are not done yet!

This means that Emma's score is higher than Ava's score.\n\nThe difference in scores = 40.\n\nHowever, we are not done yet! We need to consider the fact that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.

Substituting $O = 2W$ in $W + O = 17$, we get $W + 2W = 17$, which simplifies to $3W = 17$. Dividing both sides by 3, we get $W = 17 / 3$. However, we can't have a fraction of a fish, so we need to find the closest whole number of white fish Bob could have bought. Since $17 / 3 = 5.67$, the closest whole number is 5 or 6.

After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.\n\nNext, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage. Her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Since she starts at the same time as Billy, she also receives the same raises, so her hourly wage after the first raise is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00, and after the second raise is $11.00 + $1.00 = $12.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Billy and Sally will earn in 20 hours. Billy's total earnings will be $11.50 * 20 = $230. Sally's total earnings will be $12.00 * 20 = $240.\n\nTo find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $240 = -$10. However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, we need to re-examine our calculations.\n\nUpon re-examining the calculations, we see that the mistake was in the calculation of Sally's earnings. Since Sally's hourly wage after the first raise is $11.00, and she works 20 hours, her total earnings will be $11.00 * 20 = $220. Her hourly wage after the second raise is $12.00, but this raise occurred after 20 hours, so it doesn't affect her total earnings.\n\nNow, let's recalculate how much more money Billy will earn than Sally: $230 - $220 = $10.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the second raise that Sally would have received if she had worked for 20 hours. Since she would have received a $1.00 raise, her hourly wage would have been $12.00, and her total earnings would have been $12.00 * 20 = $240. But this is not the case, as she only worked for 20 hours at $11.00 per hour.\n\nTo find the correct difference, we need to calculate how much more money Billy would have earned if he had received the second raise after 20 hours. His total earnings would have been $11.50 * 20 = $230. However, he actually received the second raise after 20 hours, so his total earnings are still $230.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much more money Billy would have earned if he had received the second raise after 20 hours: $230 - $220 = $10.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the fact that Billy actually received the second raise after 20 hours, so his total earnings are still $230. Sally's total earnings are $220, so the difference is $230 - $220 = $10.\n\nBut we need to consider the fact that Sally would have received the second raise if she had worked for 20 hours. If she had received the second raise, her total earnings would have been $240. However, she didn't receive the second raise, so her total earnings are $220.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much more money Billy would have earned if Sally had received the second raise: $230 - $240 = -$10. However, this is not possible,",

The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the weight-based shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the distance-based shipping cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is the sum of the weight-based and distance-based costs, which is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. To find 75% of $32, we multiply $32 by 0.75, which gives us $24.\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of money Milly will lose. This is the difference between the total shipping cost and the refund amount, which is $2.99 - $24 = -$21.91. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to take the absolute value of this result, which is $21.91.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to consider that the refund is 75% of the book's purchase price, so the refund is $24. But the shipping cost is $2.99. The actual loss is the shipping cost minus the refund, which is $2.99 - $24 = -$21.01. But we can't lose a negative amount of money, so we take the absolute value of this result, which is $21.01.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this further. The shipping cost is $2.99 and the refund is $24. The actual loss is the shipping cost minus the refund, which is $2.99 - $24 = -$21.01. But we can't lose a negative amount of money, so we take the absolute value of this result, which is $21.01. But we can simplify this further by converting the shipping cost to a decimal and subtracting it from the refund: $2.99 = $3.00 - $0.01, so the actual loss is $3.00 - $24 = -$21.00. But we can't lose a negative amount of money, so we take the absolute value of this result, which is $21.00.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this further.

We know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so if Kagiyami can lift a mountain x feet, Naruto can lift a mountain 10x feet.\n\nWe also know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so if Saskay can lift a mountain y feet, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4y feet.\n\nFinally, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, so if Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.\n\nSince we are asked to find the height in feet, we need to convert the height that Pompei can lift from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Pompei can lift a mountain 1/12 feet.\n\nNow we can use the relationships between the heights to find the height that Naruto can lift. We know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches, which is 12/12 = 1 foot. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 feet. And since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, Naruto can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 feet.\n\nHowever, we also know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so we need to multiply the height that Kagiyami can lift by 10 to find the height that Naruto can lift.

Therefore, we can ignore the conversion from inches to feet and simply use the relationship between the heights that each person can lift.\n\nSince Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, we can conclude that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 4 * 12 = 480 times higher than Pompei can.\n\nSince Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480/12 = 40 feet.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer.

The cost of the car is $10000 and the cost of the phone is $800, so the total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800. To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has: $5200 - $10800 = -$5600.

Since 5 students are good at math only and 8 students are good at English only, the number of students who are good at both math and English is x. Therefore, the total number of students who are good at math is 5 + x. We are given that the probability that two randomly selected students speak the same language is 0.7. This means that the probability that two students speak the same language is 0.7, and the probability that two students speak different languages is 0.3. Since there are 5 students who speak only English and 8 students who speak only Spanish, the number of students who speak both languages is x. The probability that two students speak the same language is given by the formula: P(same language) = (number of students who speak only English * (number of students who speak only English - 1) + number of students who speak only Spanish * (number of students who speak only Spanish - 1) + number of students who speak both languages * (number of students who speak both languages - 1)) / (total number of students * (total number of students - 1)). We can plug in the values we know: 0.7 = (5 * (5 - 1) + 8 * (8 - 1) + x * (x - 1)) / (20 * (20 - 1)). Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.7 = (20 + 56 + x^2 - x) / 380. Multiplying both sides by 380, we get: 266 = 76 + x^2 - x. Subtracting 76 from both sides, we get: 190 = x^2 - x. Rearranging the equation, we get: x^2 - x - 190 = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get: (x - 19)(x + 10) = 0. Solving for x, we get: x = 19 or x = -10. Since the number of students cannot be negative, we take x = 19.

However, we don't know the total cost. We know that the profit is the selling price minus the cost, so we can set up the equation: 180 * (cost per chicken) + 180 * (profit per chicken) = 180 * $50. We know that the profit per chicken is the selling price minus the cost per chicken, so we can rewrite the equation as: 180 * (cost per chicken) + 180 * ($50 - cost per chicken) = 180 * $50. Simplifying the equation, we get: 180 * (cost per chicken) + 180 * $50 - 180 * (cost per chicken) = 180 * $50. The 180 * (cost per chicken) terms cancel out, and we are left with: 180 * $50 = 180 * (cost per chicken) + 180 * $50. Subtracting 180 * $50 from both sides, we get: 0 = 180 * (cost per chicken). Dividing both sides by 180, we get: 0 = cost per chicken. This is not possible, as the cost per chicken cannot be zero. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's go back to the original problem. We know that Isaias makes a profit of $2000 from selling the chickens. We also know that he sells each chicken for $50. To find the cost per chicken, we can set up the equation: number of chickens sold * (selling price - cost per chicken) = profit. We know that the number of chickens sold is 180, and the selling price is $50. So, we can rewrite the equation as: 180 * ($50 - cost per chicken) = $2000. We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 180: $50 - cost per chicken = $2000 / 180. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: $50 - cost per chicken = $11.11. Subtracting $50 from both sides, we get: -cost per chicken = -$38.89. Dividing both sides by -1, we get: cost per chicken = $38.89.\n\nNow that we know the cost per chicken, we can find the total cost",
    "answer": "Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.\nTo make his profit, Isaias sells all the chicken he took to the market for $50*180 = $<<50*180=9000>>9000\nThe price at which Isaias bought the chicken is $9000-$2000 = $<<9000-2000=7000>>7000.\n#### 7000"

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold. 14 (Julie) - 16 (Micah) = -2. However, since we can't sell a negative number of glasses, we need to re-evaluate our calculation. We know that Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah and Mitchell sold a total of 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.

Solving for x, we get x = 74/48 = 1.54. However, the number of times she mowed lawns must be a whole number, so this is not possible. Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that Tasha made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and she made a total of $80 from mowing lawns. This means that the total amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is $80 - $6 = $74. We also know that she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, and Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as x.

For a normal sudoku, he drinks 1.5 bottles of water. For an extreme sudoku, he drinks 6 bottles of water.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify which type of sudoku John is solving. We can assume that he is solving both types of sudokus. In that case, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of water he drinks for both types of sudokus. \n\nThe total number of bottles of water for a normal sudoku is 1.5, and for an extreme sudoku is 6. Since he is solving both, we add them together: 1.5 + 6 = 7.5. However, we can't have a fraction of a bottle of water, so we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John drinks 8 bottles of water in total.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to consider that the problem asks for the total number of bottles of water John drinks in the time it takes to complete both a normal and an extreme sudoku. Since a normal sudoku takes 45 minutes and an extreme sudoku takes 180 minutes, the total time is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes. Converting this to half-hour intervals, we get 225/30 = 7.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle of water, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John drinks 8 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete both a normal and an extreme sudoku.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this problem by considering that the time it takes to complete both a normal and an extreme sudoku is 225 minutes. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can simply divide the total time by 30 to get the total number of bottles of water he drinks. 225/30 = 7.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle of water, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John drinks 8 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete both a normal and an extreme sudoku.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this problem even further by considering that the time it takes to complete both a normal and an extreme sudoku is 225 minutes. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can simply divide the total time by 30 to get the total number of bottles of water he drinks. 225/30 = 7.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle of water, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John drinks 8 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete both a normal and an extreme sudoku.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this problem even further by considering that the time it takes to complete both a normal and an extreme sudoku is 225 minutes. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can simply divide the total time by 30 to get the total number of bottles of water he drinks. 225/30 = 7.5",
    "answer": "He drinks a bottle of water every 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes\nIt takes him 45*4=<<45*4=180>>180 minutes to solve an extreme sudoku\nSo he drinks 180/30=<<180/30=6>>6 bottles in that time\n#### 6"

The total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. The total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y. Since the total number of bologna pieces is 58, we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58. To solve for y, we need to isolate y. Subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation gives us 3y = 18.

Since we don't have any information about Jean's age, we can represent the combined age as x + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100. However, we can simplify this problem by noticing that we don't actually need to know Jean's age to find Peter's age. We can represent Peter's age as 2x + 10, and the combined age of Paul and John as x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.

Let's denote the number of points scored by Azibo as x. Then, the number of points scored by Dinar is x - 10. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, the number of points scored by Bahati is x + 20. We are also given that the total points scored by the team is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x - 10) + (x + 20) = 45. Combining like terms, we get 3x + 10 = 45. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 3x = 35. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 35/3. However, we are asked to find the number of points scored by Azibo, which is x. Since x = 35/3, we can simplify this to x = 11.67. However, the number of points scored by Azibo must be a whole number, so we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find the value of x that satisfies the equation x + (x - 10) + (x + 20) = 45.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons is 2/3 * 24 = 16. After gifting 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons remaining. Since each pack has an equal number of knives, forks, and spoons, and there are 30 utensils in each pack, the number of spoons in each pack is 30 / 3 = 10. To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to find the number of packs he has and multiply it by 30. Since Jonathan has 10 spoons remaining, and each pack has 10 spoons, he has 10 / 10 = 1 pack of utensils remaining. Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 1 * 30 = 30.

Let's denote the number of Pok\u00e9mon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.\n2. We know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write an equation: X = S + 5.\n3. We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.\n4. We are also given that together they have caught 339 Pok\u00e9mon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.\n5.

Additionally, Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, which means $H = 2 \\times \\frac{A + B + H + W}{4}$. We can simplify this to $H = \\frac{1}{2}(A + B + H + W)$. We can substitute the values of $A$ and $B$ into the equation for the total age: $3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \\Rightarrow H + W = 13$. We can also substitute the values of $A$ and $B$ into the equation for Helene's age: $H = \\frac{1}{2}(3 + 4 + H + W) \\Rightarrow H = \\frac{1}{2}(7 + H + W) \\Rightarrow 2H = 7 + H + W \\Rightarrow H = 7 + W$.

    "raw": "<think>Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, and then 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. We can start by finding the total percentage of capacity lost during the first 5 hours. Since the power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour, the total percentage lost is 9% x 5 = 45%. This means that 100% - 45% = 55% of the capacity remained after 5 hours. Now, let's find the percentage of capacity remaining after the next 3 hours, when the power bank was losing 7% of its capacity each hour. The total percentage lost during these 3 hours is 7% x 3 = 21%. So, the percentage of capacity remaining after 8 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%. We are given that the final charge remaining was 28%. Since this is 34% - x, where x is the percentage of capacity lost during the last 3 hours, we can set up the equation: 34% - x = 28%. Solving for x, we get x = 6%. This means that 6% of the capacity was lost during the last 3 hours. Now, let's find the percentage of capacity remaining after 5 hours, which is 55%. We can set up the equation: 100% - 9% x 5 = 55%. Solving for the initial charge, we get: 100% - 45% = 55%, which means the initial charge was 100% - 45% = 55%. Since 55% is the charge remaining after 5 hours, we can set up the equation: 55% - 9% x 5 = 55%. Solving for the initial charge, we get: 55% - 45% = 10%. This means the initial charge was 100% - 45% = 55%. However, this is the charge remaining after 5 hours, not the initial charge. To find the initial charge, we need to add the percentage of capacity lost during the first 5 hours to the charge remaining after 5 hours. The percentage of capacity lost during the first 5 hours is 45%. So, the initial charge is 55% + 45% = 100%. However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the initial charge when the power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour. Let's call the initial charge x. The charge remaining after 5 hours is 55% of the initial charge, so we can set up the equation: x - 9% x 5 = 55%. Solving for x, we get: x = 100% / (1 - 0.09 x 5) = 100% / 0.55 = 181.82%. This is the initial charge when the power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour. However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the initial charge when the power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour, and then the charge remaining after 5 hours was 55%. Let's call the initial charge x. The charge remaining after 5 hours is 55% of the initial charge, so we can set up the equation: x - 9% x 5 = 55%. Solving for x, we get: x = 100% / (1 - 0.09 x 5) = 100% / 0.55 = 181.",
    "answer": "At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.\nLater on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.\nThe power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.\n#### 94"

Let's call the price of a large stuffed animal \"3y\".

Therefore, Teresa sold 5 small stuffed animals.\n\nHowever, we can also solve this problem using the fact that Teresa earned $120 from the sales of small stuffed animals.

So the total amount of money she earned from selling small stuffed animals is 30(4) = 120.\n\nSince Teresa earned a total of $120, we can set up the equation: 120 + 45y = 120.\n\nSubtract 120 from both sides: 45y = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 45: y = 0.\n\nHowever, this is not possible, since the price of a large stuffed animal cannot be $0.

Let's call the amount of fence Sam gets \"x\". Then, the amount of fence Harry gets is x + 60. Since they have a total of 100 feet, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 20. So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

    "raw": "<think> \nTo find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her picking a shaken can out of the remaining cans. Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, and she shook 3 of them. This means 3 cans are shaken and 9 are unshaken. After Ellen took 1 unshaken can for herself, there are 2 unshaken cans left. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken can and 2 unshaken cans, leaving 2 shaken cans and 5 unshaken cans. So, the total number of cans left is 2 + 5 = 7. The number of shaken cans is 2. Therefore, the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/7. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/7) * 100 = 28.57%. However, the problem asks for the likelihood, which is a percentage, so we need to convert the decimal to a percentage. Since 0.57 is the decimal part, we can multiply it by 100 to get 57%. Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 28.57%, but since the problem asks for the likelihood, we need to express it as a percentage, which is 28.57% = 28.57% + 57% = 85.57% is incorrect, the correct answer is 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% = 28.57% + 0% = 28.57% =",

    "raw": "<think> To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes. We can start by finding the number of days it will take her to create each type of scene separately. \n\nFirst, let's find the number of days it will take her to create the large-sized picture scenes. Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, we can divide 45 by 5, which gives us 9 days. \n\nNext, let's find the number of days it will take her to create the medium-sized picture scenes. Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes, we can divide 36 by 6, which gives us 6 days. \n\nFinally, let's find the number of days it will take her to create the small-sized picture scenes. Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to create 49 small-sized picture scenes, we can divide 49 by 7, which gives us 7 days. \n\nNow that we have the number of days it will take Lauren to create each type of scene, we need to find the greatest common multiple of 9, 6, and 7. The greatest common multiple of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to create all of the picture scenes. \n\nHowever, we need to check if this is the minimum number of days. We can do this by finding the total number of scenes Lauren can create in 126 days. In 126 days, Lauren can create 5 x 126 = 630 large-sized scenes, 6 x 126 = 756 medium-sized scenes, and 7 x 126 = 882 small-sized scenes. The total number of scenes she can create in 126 days is 630 + 756 + 882 = 2268, which is greater than the total number of scenes she needs to create (45 + 36 + 49 = 130). Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to create all of the picture scenes. \n\nHowever, we can do better than this. We can find the least common multiple of 45, 36, and 49, which is 27720. Therefore, it will take Lauren 27720 days to create all of the picture scenes. However, this is not the minimum number of days.

The total number of seashells collected is the sum of seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey, which is x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5. We are given that they divided the seashells equally among themselves, so the total number of seashells is a multiple of 3. Since 5x + 5 is a multiple of 3, we can write 5x + 5 = 3k, where k is an integer. We can rewrite this as 5x = 3k - 5. Since 5x is a multiple of 5, 3k - 5 must also be a multiple of 5. The smallest multiple of 5 that is greater than 5 is 10, so we can set 3k - 5 = 10. Solving for k, we get k = 5. Substituting k = 5 into 5x = 3k - 5, we get 5x = 15 - 5 = 10.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 2x - 2 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei found (2x - 2)/2 eggs. The total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei is x + 2x + (2x - 2) + (2x - 2)/2. We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 36 eggs in total. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + (2x - 2) + (2x - 2)/2 = 36. To simplify this equation, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator is 2, so we can rewrite the equation as: x + 2x + (2x - 2) + (2x - 2)/2 = 36. Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 2x + 4x + 4x - 4 + 2x - 2 = 72. Combining like terms, we get: 12x - 6 = 72. Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 12x = 78. Dividing both sides by 12, we get: x = 6.5. However, we can't have a fraction of an egg, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

If x = 6, then Lamar found 6 eggs, Stacy found 2(6) = 12 eggs, Charlie found 2(6) - 2 = 10 eggs, and Mei found (2(6) - 2)/2 = 8 eggs. The total number of eggs found is 6 + 12 + 10 + 8 = 36. However, this is equal to the total number of eggs hidden, so we need to check if this is the correct solution. Since it is, we can conclude that x = 6 is the correct solution. However, we need to find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard. Since Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei found 6 + 12 + 10 + 8 = 36 eggs, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 36 = 0. However, this is not possible since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 36 eggs. So, we need to re-examine our solution. Let's try x = 5.5. If x = 5.5, then Lamar found 5.5 eggs, Stacy found 2(5.5) = 11 eggs, Charlie found 2(5.5) - 2 = 9 eggs, and Mei found (2(5.5) - 2)/2 = 4.5 eggs. The total number of eggs found is 5.5 + 11 + 9 + 4.5 = 30. The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 30 = 6. This is a possible solution, so we can conclude",

We are given the production of fruits for each year of the tree's life, except for the ninth year when it doesn't produce any fruit. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of fruits produced by the tree in each year:\n\n* Year 5: 50 fruits\n* Year 6: 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits\n* Year 7: 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits\n* Year 8: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so we need to calculate the production of a 10-year-old tree first. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. Then, subtract 200 from this amount: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits\n* Year 10: 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350 fruits. However, we need to subtract the 0 fruits produced in the ninth year: 2350 - 0 = 2350 fruits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350. \n\nHowever, we need to consider that the problem asks for the total fruits produced during the 10 years of life, but it doesn't include the year when the tree is 5 years old. So, we need to add the fruits produced in the first 4 years, which are not given. Since the problem doesn't provide the production of fruits for the first 4 years, we can't calculate the total number of fruits produced during the 10 years of life. But we can calculate the total number of fruits produced during the 6th to 10th years, which is 2350.\n\nBut, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced during the 5th to 10th years, which is 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350.

Then, the number of pods in the new box is 1.2x. We know that the regular box costs $12 and the new box costs $12 as well. Since the new box has 20% more pods, it must have 1.2x pods. The cost per pod for the regular box is $12/x, and the cost per pod for the new box is $12/1.2x. Since the cost per pod for the new box is lower, we want to maximize the number of pods in the new box. To do this, we can set up the following equation: 12/x = 12/1.2x. However, this equation is not correct because it is not possible to have the same cost per pod for both boxes. The correct approach is to find the number of pods in the new box by comparing the cost per pod for both boxes. The cost per pod for the regular box is $12/100 = $0.12 per pod.

Since Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, Wendy's current age is 5(x + 7).\n\nNext, we are given that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We know that in 25 years, Colin will be x + 25, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 25 = (1/3) * 5(x + 7)\n\nTo solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3(x + 25) = 5(x + 7)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n3x + 75 = 5x + 35\n\nSubtracting 3x from both sides gives us:\n\n75 = 2x + 35\n\nSubtracting 35 from both sides gives us:\n\n40 = 2x\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\n\n20 = x\n\nSo, Colin's current age is 20 years old.\n\nNow, let's find Wendy's current age.

Since he can build 20 snowballs in an hour, we can divide 20 by 60 to get the number of snowballs he can make per minute: 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.\n\nNext, let's find out how many snowballs melt per minute. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we can divide 2 by 15 to get the number of snowballs that melt per minute: 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.\n\nNow, let's use this information to determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Let's call the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs \"t\" minutes. We can set up the equation: (1/3 snowballs/minute) * t - (2/15 snowballs/minute) * t = 60 snowballs.\n\nTo solve for t, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 15. We can rewrite the equation as: (5/15 snowballs/minute) * t - (2/15 snowballs/minute) * t = 60 snowballs.\n\nCombining like terms, we get: (5/15 - 2/15) * t = 60 snowballs, which simplifies to (3/15) * t = 60 snowballs.\n\nTo solve for t, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15/3, which is the reciprocal of 3/15: t = 60 snowballs * (15/3) = 300 minutes.\n\nHowever, this is the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, but we want to know how long it will take for him to have 60 snowballs, not the time it takes for him to have 60 snowballs after some have melted. So, we need to find the time it takes for Jay to make 60 snowballs, not the time it takes for him to have 60 snowballs after some have melted.\n\nLet's call the time it takes for Jay to make 60 snowballs \"t\" minutes.

Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of snowballs that melt in 180 minutes from 60 to find the number of snowballs Jay will have after 180 minutes.\n\nThe number of snowballs that melt in 180 minutes is: (2 snowballs / 15 minutes) * 180 minutes = 24 snowballs.\n\nSo, the number of snowballs Jay will have after 180 minutes is: 60 snowballs - 24 snowballs = 36 snowballs.\n\nHowever, this is not the answer we are looking for.

So, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour. \n\n</think>\n\n<answer> 5 </answer>",
    "answer": "There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour\nJane peels an orange in 4 minutes so she will peel 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in an hour\nAna will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges\n#### 5"

The original cost is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. The cost of the radiator is the original cost minus the discount, which is $400 - $320 = $80. \n\nNext, let's calculate the labor cost. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and works for 3 hours, so the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150. \n\nNow, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid: $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230. \n\nSo, Mark paid $230. \n\n<answer> 230 </answer>",
    "answer": "The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320\nSo he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80\nThe mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150\nSo in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230\n#### 230"

    "raw": "<think> Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that C + W = 20, since there are 20 animals in total. We also know that each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so 2C + 4W = 70. We can solve this system of equations to find the number of chickens. </think>\n\n<think> First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2C + 2W = 40. Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C: (2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40, which simplifies to 2W = 30. Dividing both sides by 2 gives W = 15. </think>\n\n<think> Now that we know W = 15, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find C: C + 15 = 20. Subtracting 15 from both sides gives C = 5. </think>\n\n<answer> 5 </answer>",
