To find the distance covered each day, we need to divide the total distance by 2. \n\nDistance covered by the first train each day = 80 miles + 150 miles / 2 = 115 miles\n\nDistance covered by the second train each day = 80 miles + 150 miles / 2 = 115 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance covered by the first train in the two days is 115 miles + 115 miles = 230 miles, and the distance covered by the second train in the two days is 115 miles + 115 miles = 230 miles. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the distance covered by each train in the two days, not the distance covered each day. Therefore, the final answer is 230 miles for the first train and 230 miles for the second train. \n\nBut, we need to find the distance covered by each train separately. Let's denote the distance covered by the first train as d1 and the distance covered by the second train as d2. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train: \n\nd1 = sqrt(80^2 + 150^2) = sqrt(6400 + 22500) = sqrt(28900) = 170 miles\n\nd2 = sqrt(80^2 + 150^2) = sqrt(6400 + 22500) = sqrt(28900) =",
    "answer": "On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.\nThey also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.\nThe combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles\nThe average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train\n#### 230"

Since she has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk. \n\nWe know that she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles. We can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time. We can rearrange this formula to solve for total time: total time = total distance / average speed. Plugging in the values, we get total time = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours. \n\nSince she has already taken 2 hours, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles. \n\nNow, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. Plugging in the values, we get speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph. \n\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour. \n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the fact that she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, which is at a speed of 3 miles per hour. This means that she will be walking at a speed of 6 miles per hour for the remaining 6 miles, but she will also be walking at a speed of 3 miles per hour for the first 6 miles. \n\nTo find the average speed for the entire hike, we can use the formula: average speed = (distance1 * speed1 + distance2 * speed2) / total distance. Plugging in the values, we get average speed = (6 * 3 + 6 * 6) / 12 = (18 + 36) / 12 = 54 / 12 = 4.5 mph.\n\nHowever, this is not the speed at which she needs to walk the remaining distance. This is the average speed for the entire hike. We need to find the speed at which she needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.\n\nLet's call the speed at which she needs to walk the remaining distance \"x\". We can set up the equation: (6 * 3 + 6 * x) / 12 = 4. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: (18 + 6x) / 12 = 4. \n\nMultiplying both sides by 12, we get: 18 + 6x = 48. \n\nSubtracting 18 from both sides, we get: 6x = 30. \n\nDividing both sides by 6, we get: x = 5.\n\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 5 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike. \n\nHowever, this is not the final answer.

So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of jewels Siobhan has, but the prompt also mentions that we need to find the total number of jewels they have. To find the total number of jewels, we need to add the number of jewels each person has: Raymond has 40 jewels, Aaron has 25 jewels, and Siobhan has 23 jewels. The total number of jewels is 40 + 25 + 23 = 88. \n\nSo, the total number of jewels is 88. However, the question only asks for the number of jewels Siobhan has, which is 23.

We know that each time he goes to the movies, he spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, for a total of $14 per visit.\n\nLet's divide the total amount Peter has ($42) by the cost per visit ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies:\n\n$42 \u00f7 $14 = 3\n\nSo, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with the $42 he has for the week.\n\nHowever, we need to check if he has enough money left after 3 visits. If he goes 3 times, he will spend a total of $14 x 3 = $42. This means he will have spent all his money, and he won't have any left over.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3, but we need to make sure that Peter has enough money left after 3 visits.

If he goes 4 times, he will spend $14 x 4 = $56, which is more than the $42 he has.

This is the original price of the groceries.\n\nNext, the delivery vendor added a 25% fee to the final total. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of $40.00. This is done by multiplying $40.00 by 0.25, which is $40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00.\n\nNow, we add the 25% fee to the original price of the groceries: $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.\n\nThen, the delivery vendor charged Stephen $3.00 in delivery fees. We add this to the previous total: $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.\n\nFinally, Stephen added a $4.00 tip. We add this to the previous total: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.\n\nSo, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.\n\nHowever, we need to find the original price of the groceries before the extra fees. To do this, we need to subtract the 25% fee and the delivery fees from the final total.\n\nThe 25% fee is $10.00, and the delivery fees are $3.00, for a total of $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.\n\nWe subtract this from the final total: $57.00 - $13.00 = $44.00.\n\nTherefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $44.00.\n\nHowever, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the original price of the groceries before the extra fees. We know that the final bill came to $40.00, and the extra fees added up to $13.00.

A 2% discount on the total cost amounts to $750 * 2 / 100 = 1500 / 100 = 15$. So the discount reduces the price to $750 - 15 = 735$. \n\nHowever, this is not the total amount Shiela will pay.

We know it takes him 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it. Since we're dealing with minutes and seconds, we'll convert the cutting time to minutes by dividing by 60. 5 seconds / 60 = 1/12 minutes. So, it takes Billy 1.5 + 1/12 = 1.4166666666666667 minutes to peel and cut one potato. Now, we can multiply this time by the total number of potatoes he has to prep, which is 60. 1.4166666666666667 * 60 = 85.00000000000001 minutes. So, it will take Billy approximately 85 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes. However, we can simplify this by converting the decimal part to a fraction. 1.4166666666666667 = 1 + 4/7. So, it will take Billy 1 + 4/7 * 60 = 60 + 4 * 8.571428571428571 = 60 + 35.71428571428571 = 95.71428571428571 minutes. Since we're dealing with minutes, we can approximate this to 95.71 minutes.

    "raw": "<think> Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Juan and Carlos make a profit of $25, and they sell each glass for $0.50. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue from selling one gallon is 20 x $0.50 = $10. Since they made a profit of $25, the total cost of making one gallon must be $10 - $25 = -$15. However, the cost of making one gallon cannot be negative, so this means that they must have sold more than one gallon to make a profit of $25. Let's call the number of gallons they made x. The total revenue from selling x gallons is 20x x $0.50 = $10x. The total cost of making x gallons is $3x + $2x = $5x. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so we can set up the equation: $10x - $5x = $25. Simplifying the equation, we get $5x = $25. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 5. So they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of making one gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost of making one gallon is $5.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of straw given to the rats is 3r * 6 = 18r.\n* There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.\n* The total number of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160, and we know that 50 of it is given to the hamsters, so the remaining straw given to the rats is 160 - 50 = 110.\n* Since the total straw given to the rats is 18r, we can set up the equation 18r = 110 to find the number of rats in each cage.\n* Solving for r, we get r = 110 / 18 = 6.11 (approximately). However, since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 6.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this solution is correct. If there are 6 rats in each cage, the total number of straw given to the rats is 3 * 6 * 6 = 108, which is less than 110. This means that our initial assumption of 6 rats in each cage is incorrect.\n\nLet's try again. If we assume that there are 7 rats in each cage, the total number of straw given to the rats is 3 * 7 * 6 = 126, which is more than 110. This means that our assumption of 7 rats in each cage is also incorrect.\n\nLet's try 6.5 rats in each cage. The total number of straw given to the rats is 3 * 6.5 * 6 = 117.5, which is still more than 110.\n\nLet's try 6 rats in each cage and a fraction of a rat in the last cage. If there are 6 rats in each of the first two cages, the total number of straw given to the rats is 2 * 6 * 6 = 72. The remaining straw is 110 - 72 = 38. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the number of straw given to the last cage is 38 / 6 = 6.33 (approximately). This means that there are 6 rats in the first two cages and 6.33 rats in the last cage, which is still not a whole number.\n\nLet's try 5 rats in each of the first two cages and 6 rats in the last cage. The total number of straw given to the rats in the first two cages is 2 * 5 * 6 = 60. The total number of straw given to the rats in the last cage is 6 * 6 = 36. The total number of straw given to the rats is 60 + 36 = 96. The remaining straw is 110 - 96 = 14. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the number of straw given to the last cage is 14 / 6 = 2.33 (approximately). This means that there are 5 rats in the first two cages and 2.33 rats in the last cage, which is still not a whole number.\n\nLet's try 5 rats in each of the first three cages. The total number of straw given to the rats in the first three cages is 3 * 5 * 6",
    "answer": "In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.\nBetween the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.\nAs the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw \u2013 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.\nSo in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.\nThis means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.\n#### 5"

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so we have the equation: $B = 2A$. We also know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. So, we can express Mark's earnings from Publisher A as $5 \\times 1000 = 5000$ cents. Since Mark earns the same number of sentences from both publishers, his earnings from Publisher B will be $B \\times 1000$. We are given that Mark's total earnings from both publishers is $5000 + B \\times 1000$. We can now substitute $B = 2A$ into the equation and solve for $A$: $5000 + 2A \\times 1000 = 5000 + 2000A$. We know that Mark earns 5000 cents from Publisher A, so we can set up the equation: $5000 + 2000A = 5000 + B \\times 1000$. Since we know that $B = 2A$, we can substitute this into the equation: $5000 + 2000A = 5000 + 2A \\times 1000$. We can simplify the equation by combining like terms: $2000A = 2A \\times 1000$. We can divide both sides of the equation by 2000 to solve for $A$: $A = \\frac{2A \\times 1000}{2000}$. We can simplify the equation by canceling out the common factor of $A$: $A = \\frac{2 \\times 1000}{2000}$. We can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2: $A = \\frac{1000}{1000}$. We can simplify the fraction by canceling out the common factor of 1000: $A = 1$. Now that we know $A = 1$, we can find $B$: $B = 2A = 2 \\times 1 = 2$. Now that we know $A$ and $B$, we can find Mark's total earnings from both publishers: $5000 + 2 \\times 1000 = 5000 + 2000 = 7000$. Therefore, Mark makes 7000 cents in a week. Since we are asked to express the answer in cents, we can convert 7000 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: $7000 \\div 100 = 70$. Therefore, Mark makes $70 in a week.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + 2 * 20 = $30 + $40 = $70. Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more to afford the jacket and shoes. She earns $5 for each babysitting job, so she needs to babysit $60 / $5 = 12 times to earn enough money. However, she also earns $4 for each lawn mowing job, so we need to consider this as well. Let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn. She earns $5 for each babysitting job and she needs to babysit 12 times, so she earns $5 * 12 = $60 from babysitting. She earns $4 for each lawn mowing job, and let's call the number of times she mows the lawn x. So, she earns $4x from mowing the lawn. The total amount she earns is $60 + $4x. Since she needs to earn $60 to afford the jacket and shoes, we can set up the equation $60 + $4x = $60. Subtracting $60 from both sides, we get $4x = $0. Dividing both sides by $4, we get x = 0.

She earns $4 for each lawn mowing job, and let's call the number of times she mows the lawn x. So, she earns $4x from mowing the lawn. The total amount she earns is $60 + $4x. Since she needs to earn $70 to afford the jacket and shoes, we can set up the equation $60 + $4x = $70. Subtracting $60 from both sides, we get $4x = $10. Dividing both sides by $4, we get x = 2.5.

We also know that her mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits, so the total number of outfits is 3x + 24 + 15 = 3x + 39. Since the total number of outfits is also x, we can set up the equation: x = 3x + 39. Rearranging terms, we get: 2x = 39. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 19.5. However, the number of outfits has to be an integer, so this is not a valid answer. This means that the information given is not consistent with the assumption that we made. Our assumption was that the total number of outfits is an integer. So let's rephrase the given information in a different way: Let x be the total number of outfits that Laurel had before her friend gave her 24 outfits. Then, she had x + 24 outfits. At her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits, which is 2(x + 24). So, the total number of outfits she has now is x + 24 + 2(x + 24) = 3x + 48. We also know that her mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits, so the total number of outfits is 3x + 48 + 15 = 3x + 63. Since the total number of outfits is also x + 24 + 2(x + 24) + 15, we can set up the equation: x + 24 + 2(x + 24) + 15 = 3x + 63. Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 24 + 2x + 48 + 15 = 3x + 63. Combining like terms, we get: 3x + 87 = 3x + 63. Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get: 87 = 63. This is a contradiction, so the information given is not consistent. However, we can try to find a solution by assuming that the total number of outfits is a multiple of 3. Let's try to find the smallest multiple of 3 that satisfies the equation x + 24 + 2(x + 24) + 15 = 3x + 63. We can rewrite the equation as: x + 24 + 2x + 48 + 15 = 3x + 63. Combining like terms, we get: 3x + 87 = 3x + 63. Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get: 87 = 63. This is still a contradiction. However, we can try to find a solution by assuming that the total number of outfits is a multiple of 3 plus 1. Let's try to find the smallest multiple of 3 plus 1 that satisfies the equation x + 24 + 2(x + 24) + 15 = 3x + 63. We can rewrite the equation as: x + 24 + 2x + 48 + 15 = 3x + 63.

We also know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. This means that Erin's current score is 3 times Sara's score, which is 3 * 8 = 24 points. Since Erin scored 14 points after scoring some initial points, we can set up the equation: x + 14 = 24. To find Erin's initial score, we need to solve for x. Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 24 - 14 = 10. So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points, but it does not ask for the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points in relation to Sara's score. Therefore, we need to find the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points in relation to Sara's score. We know that Erin's current score is 24 points, which is 3 times Sara's score. So, Erin's initial score was 24 - 14 = 10 points. But this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points in relation to Sara's score.

We need to find the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points in relation to Sara's score. Let's denote Erin's initial score as x.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 14 = 24 + 3y. Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 10 + 3y. We know that Erin's current score is 24 points, which is 3 times Sara's score. So, we can set up the equation: 10 + 3y = 24. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get 3y = 14. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get y = 14/3 = 4.6667.

Since the area of the room is 360 square feet, we can set up the equation: $A = lw$, where $A$ is the area, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width. We are given that the length is 3 yards, but we need to convert it to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is $3 \\times 3 = 9$ feet. Now we can substitute the values into the equation: $360 = 9w$. To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9: $w = 360 : 9 = 40$. Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room, which is given by the formula $P = 2l + 2w$. Substituting the values of length and width, we get: $P = 2(9) + 2(40) = 18 + 80 = 98$.

We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid: $48 - $4 = $44.\n\nNow, we know that Tom could have bought x CDs with the $44 he saved by not buying the headphone set.

He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half. Let's assume he saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Then, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half of the month. Since there are 15 days in the first half of April and 15 days in the second half, the total amount saved in the first half is 15x, and the total amount saved in the second half is 15(2x) = 30x. The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is 15x + 30x = 45x. Since Elvis's target is $1125, we can set up the equation 45x = 1125 to solve for x. Solving for x, we get x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are notified. We can see that the number of new families notified in each round is 3 times the number of families notified in the previous round. \n\nWe are asked to find the number of families notified in the fourth round. To do this, we need to find the number of families notified in the third round and multiply it by 3. In the third round, 27 families were notified. Therefore, in the fourth round, 27 x 3 = 81 families will be notified. \n\nHowever, this counts each family twice (once for each person in the family), so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of families notified. Therefore, the number of families notified in the fourth round is 81 / 2 = 40.5. However, since we can't have a fraction of a family, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of families notified in the fourth round is 40. \n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.

He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, which is 7 days. So, he will spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

So, he will spend $30 / 4 = $7.50 per day on plastic action figures.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many wooden action figures he bought. He spent $40 on wooden action figures, and each wooden action figure costs $5. So, he bought $40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many plastic action figures he bought. He spent $7.50 per day on plastic action figures for 4 days, which is $7.50 * 4 = $30. He spent $30 on plastic action figures, and each plastic action figure costs $2.

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we can divide 90 by 45 to find the number of contacts needed per day: 90 / 45 = 2 contacts per day. Since Pete will need contacts for 90 days, we can multiply the number of contacts per day by the number of days: 2 contacts/day * 90 days = 180 contacts. Since each box contains 90 contacts, we can divide the total number of contacts needed by the number of contacts per box to find the number of boxes needed: 180 contacts / 90 contacts/box = 2 boxes. Since Pete will buy 2 boxes, we can multiply the cost of one box by 2 to find the total cost: $100.00/box * 2 boxes = $200.00. Since the boxes are 10% off, we can calculate the discount: $200.00 * 0.10 = $20.00. To find the final cost, we can subtract the discount from the total cost: $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, we can divide the final cost by 2 to find the cost per box: $180.00 / 2 = $90.00.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. We need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. \n\nLet's denote the number of classes Manny misses as x. Then, the number of classes he attends is 10 - x. The cost per class is the total cost divided by the number of classes attended, which is $60 / (10 - x). We want this cost to be less than or equal to $10. \n\nSo, we set up the inequality: $60 / (10 - x) \u2264 $10. \n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by (10 - x), which gives us $60 \u2264 $10(10 - x). \n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get $60 \u2264 $100 - $10x. \n\nSubtracting $60 from both sides, we get $0 \u2264 $40 - $10x. \n\nAdding $10x to both sides, we get $10x \u2264 $40. \n\nDividing both sides by $10, we get x \u2264 4. \n\nSo, Manny can miss at most 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again. \n\nHowever, we need to find the number of classes he can miss, not the maximum number. Since the cost per class is $10 or less when he misses 4 classes, he can miss 3 classes and still have a cost per class of $10 or less. \n\nTherefore, Manny can miss 3 classes before his parents won't sign him up again. \n\nThe answer is 3.",
    "answer": "He must attend at least six classes, because 60 / 6 = <<60/6=10>>10\nHe can skip 4 class because 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6\n#### 4"

    "raw": "<think> To solve this problem, we need to determine how many good days are left in the month after the first 30 days. We know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days, and the next 3 days were good. So, we need to subtract the number of good days already recorded from the total number of good days in the month. However, we don't know the total number of good days in the month. We can calculate the total number of good days in the month by subtracting the number of bad days and neutral days from the total number of days in the month. The total number of days in the month is 30, and the number of bad days and neutral days is 8 + 8 = 16. So, the total number of good days in the month is 30 - 16 = 14. Now, we can subtract the number of good days already recorded from the total number of good days in the month to find the number of good days left in the month. The number of good days already recorded is 12 + 3 = 15. So, the number of good days left in the month is 14 - 15 = -1. However, this is not possible since we can't have a negative number of good days. This means that the initial assumption that the next 3 days were good is incorrect. The next 3 days must be bad, neutral, or a mix of both. We can recalculate the number of good days left in the month for each of these possibilities. If the next 3 days were bad, the number of good days left in the month would be 12 + 3 = 15. If the next 3 days were neutral, the number of good days left in the month would be 12 + 3 = 15. If the next 3 days were a mix of good and bad days, we can calculate the number of good days left in the month as follows: Let's say the next 3 days were 1 good day and 2 bad days. The number of good days left in the month would be 12 + 1 = 13. Let's say the next 3 days were 2 good days and 1 bad day. The number of good days left in the month would be 12 + 2 = 14. Let's say the next 3 days were 3 good days. The number of good days left in the month would be 12 + 3 = 15. Since we can't have a negative number of good days, the only possible answer is 15. However, we need to consider the fact that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days were not all good. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month cannot be 15. The only possible answer is 13. However, we need to consider the fact that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days were not all good.

We know she has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. So, the total number of stuffed animals she currently has is 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14. \n\nNext, we need to find out what percentage of her stuffed animals are goats. We know that she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Since the total percentage must add up to 100%, we can find the percentage of other animals as follows: 100% - 30% = 70%. This means that 70% of her stuffed animals are not goats. \n\nNow, let's find out how many stuffed animals are not goats. We can multiply the total number of stuffed animals (14) by the percentage of non-goats (70%): 14 x 70/100 = 14 x 0.7 = 9.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to 9. \n\nThis means that 9 of her stuffed animals are not goats. Since she has a total of 14 stuffed animals, the number of stuffed goats she has is 14 - 9 = 5. \n\nHowever, this is the number of stuffed goats she currently has, not the number she needs to buy. To find out how many stuffed goats she needs to buy, we need to find out how many stuffed goats she needs to have in order to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30%. \n\nLet's call the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy x. Then, the total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation: (5 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3. \n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 5 + x = 0.3(14 + x). Expanding the right-hand side, we get 5 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x. Subtracting 0.3x from both sides, we get 5 + 0.7x = 4.2. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 0.7x = -0.8. Dividing both sides by 0.7, we get x = -1.14. \n\nHowever, this is not a valid solution, since we can't have a negative number of stuffed animals. This means that Bubbles already has enough stuffed goats to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30%. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any more stuffed goats. \n\nHowever, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Since she already has 5 stuffed goats, and she needs to have 30% of the total number of stuffed animals to be goats, we can set up the equation: 5 / (14 + x) = 0.3. \n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 5 = 0.3(14 + x). Expanding the right-hand side, we get 5 = 4.2 + 0.3x. Subtracting 4.2 from both sides, we get 0.8 = 0.3x.

Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2x. Similarly, since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2(2x) = 4x. We also know that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so the amount of sugar is also 2x. \n\nSince the total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients must be equal to 10. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + x + 2x + 4x + 2x = 10. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 10. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 10/8 = 1.25. \n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the amount of oil used. Since the amount of oil is 4x, we have 4(1.25) = 5 ounces of oil. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the amount of oil in ounces, and since we can't have a fraction of an ounce, we'll assume that Tanya can use a fraction of an ounce of oil.

She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes to record. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes. \n\nShe also spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. \n\nAdditionally, she spends 15 minutes each day doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. Since there are 6 days in a week, she spends 15 * 6 = 90 minutes a week doing her makeup. \n\nNow, let's add up the time she spends on each task: 72 minutes (recording videos) + 120 minutes (writing songs) + 90 minutes (doing makeup) = 282 minutes. \n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 282 / 60 = 4.7 hours. \n\nNow, we multiply the time she spends on TikTok each week by 4 to get the total time she spends on TikTok in a month: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours. \n\nTherefore, Britany spends 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month. \n\nHowever, the problem asks for the total time in minutes, so we need to convert 18.8 hours to minutes: 18.8 * 60 = 1128 minutes. \n\nSo, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month. \n\n</think> \n<answer> 1128 </answer>",

Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.\n\nNow, we can divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year ($2640) by the number of pairs of shoes bought in a year (24) to find the average cost of each pair of shoes.\n\nAverage cost per pair = Total amount spent in a year / Number of pairs of shoes bought in a year\n= $2640 / 24\n= $110\n\nSo, James pays $110 on average for each pair of shoes. \n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the offer that James gets on the second pair of shoes. The offer is that the second pair is half off the original price. \n\nLet's assume the original price of each pair of shoes is x. Then, the total amount spent on shoes in a year is 2x + 0.5x = 2.5x. We know that this is equal to $2640, so we can set up the equation:\n\n2.5x = 2640\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2.5:\n\nx = 2640 / 2.5\nx = 1056\n\nSo, the original price of each pair of shoes is $1056. However, the second pair is half off, so James pays 0.5x for the second pair.\n\nNow, we can find the average cost of each pair of shoes:\n\nAverage cost per pair = (x + 0.5x) / 2\n= (1056 + 528) / 2\n= 1584 / 2\n= 792\n\nTherefore, James pays $792 on average for each pair of shoes, considering the offer on the second pair. \n\nHowever, this is still not the final answer. We need to consider the extra discount of a fourth off the total amount. \n\nLet's find the total amount spent on shoes in a year, considering the offer and the extra discount:\n\nTotal amount spent in a year = 2x + 0.5x - (1/4)(2.5x)\n= 2.5x - (1/4)(2.5x)\n= 2.5x - 0.625x\n= 1.875x\n\nWe know that this is equal to $2640, so we can set up the equation:\n\n1.875x = 2640\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.875:\n\nx = 2640 / 1.875\nx = 1408\n\nSo, the original price of each pair of shoes is $1408. However, the second pair is half off, so James pays 0.5x for the second pair.\n\nNow, we can find the average cost of each pair of shoes:\n\nAverage cost per pair = (x + 0.5x) / 2\n= (1408 + 704) / 2\n= 2112 / 2\n= 1056\n\nHowever, this is still not the final answer.

We can set up an equation to represent the total amount of money Tasha made from mowing lawns: 6x + 3x + 5x = 80. Combining like terms, we get 14x = 80. Dividing both sides by 14, we get x = 5.67. However, since Tasha can't mow a fraction of a lawn, we'll round down to 5 lawns for Joe, 15 lawns for Kamala, and 25 lawns for Alba. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Tasha made from mowing lawns: 6 * 5 + 6 * 15 + 6 * 25 = 30 + 90 + 150 = 270. Since Tasha made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 270 = -190. However, this is not possible since Tasha can't make a negative amount of money.

The revenue generated by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a day is 1080 * 6 = $6480.\n\nSince the problem asks for the revenue generated over a month with 30 days, we need to multiply the daily revenue by 30.

We are asked to find the number of flights to France, which is (1/4)x.\n\nWe are also given that the second plane makes 44 trips per day, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes.

She also buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound, so the cost of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18. \n\nThe total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40. \n\nAmor starts with $50 cash, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the initial amount of cash: $50 - $40 = $10. \n\nTherefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat. \n\n</think>\n<answer> 10 </answer>",

    "raw": "<think> \nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in college and the total amount of money he earned from his college degree. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in college. He received $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of money he lost is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned from his college degree. He had a $25,000 a year job before college, and his college degree tripled his income, so his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year. Since he worked for 4 years after college, the total amount of money he earned is $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned from his college degree minus the total amount of money he lost while in college. This is $300,000 - $200,000 = $100,000.\n\nSince Jim earned $100,000 more from his college degree than he lost while in college, he effectively earned $100,000 more than he would have if he had not gone to college. To find out how long it would take him to earn this amount, we can divide $100,000 by his new income of $75,000 per year. This is $100,000 / $75,000 = 1.33 years.\n\nTherefore, it would take Jim approximately 1.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the time it would take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, not the money earned from the college degree. To find this, we need to add the 4 years Jim spent in college to the 1.33 years it would take him to earn the difference. This is 4 + 1.33 = 5.33 years.\n\nTherefore, it would take Jim approximately 5.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.\n\n<answer> 5.33 </answer>",
    "answer": "His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year\nSo he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year\nHis loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000\nHe lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working\nSo he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000\nThat means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years\n#### 4"

We know that the total number of bikes sold is 300, so $M + B + T = 300$. We also know that half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so $T = 300 / 2 = 150$. We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, so $B = 0.15 * 300 = 45$. Now we can find $M$: $M = 300 - T - B = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105$.

Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted y. Then, Camden painted y + 12 eggs. We can write an equation based on the total number of eggs: x + x + (y + 12) + y = 56. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 2y + 12 = 56. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2x + 2y = 44. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x + y = 22. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, we can write y = x - 12. Substituting this into the equation x + y = 22, we get x + (x - 12) = 22. Simplifying, we get 2x - 12 = 22. Adding 12 to both sides, we get 2x = 34. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 17. Since x is the number of eggs Arnold painted, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can find the number of eggs Camden painted by finding the value of y.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, which means he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops. \n\nWe are also given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's denote the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop as x. Then, the number of potatoes needed for 3 scoops is 3x. We are told that 3x is equal to 3 less than 6, which can be written as 3x = 6 - 3 = 3. Solving for x, we get x = 1. \n\nNow that we know it takes 1 potato to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. Since Gomer ate 18 scoops, he ate 18 * 1 = 18 potatoes. \n\nHowever, we need to consider the fact that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which means he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops. This is consistent with our previous calculation. Therefore, Gomer ate 18 potatoes. \n\nHowever, we need to check if this is consistent with the information given in the problem. We are told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means that 3x = 3 - 1 = 2, where x is the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop.

This is not consistent with our previous calculation. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. \n\nLet's re-examine the information given in the problem.

We are told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means that 3x = 6 - 3 = 3, where x is the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop. Solving for x, we get x = 1. \n\nHowever, we are also told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since she can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, we can divide the total number of large-sized picture scenes by 5 to find the number of days: 45 / 5 = 9 days.\n\nNext, let's find the number of days it will take her to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes. Since she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, we can divide the total number of medium-sized picture scenes by 6 to find the number of days: 36 / 6 = 6 days.\n\nFinally, let's find the number of days it will take her to create 49 small-sized picture scenes. Since she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, we can divide the total number of small-sized picture scenes by 7 to find the number of days: 49 / 7 = 7 days.\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9, 6, and 7 to determine the number of days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes.

To find the correct answer, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9, 6, and 7.\n\nThe LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. This means that Lauren will need to work for 126 days to create all the picture scenes.\n\nHowever, this is still not the correct answer because it doesn't take into account the fact that Lauren can only work on one type of picture scene per day. To find the correct answer, we need to find the smallest number of days that is a multiple of 9, 6, and 7.\n\nThe smallest number of days that is a multiple of 9, 6, and 7 is 126.

He sells each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. To find the total profit, we need to find the total revenue and subtract the total cost. The total revenue is the number of devices sold multiplied by the selling price, which is 6 * $40 = $240. The total cost is the number of devices bought multiplied by the buying price, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120. So, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday. \n\nHowever, we need to find the total profit earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday. Since he bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, he sold 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. The profit from selling the devices on Monday is 2 * ($40 - $20) = 2 * $20 = $40. The profit from selling the devices on Tuesday is 4 * ($40 - $20) = 4 * $20 = $80.

He sells this remaining land for $3 per square meter. The amount he earns from selling this remaining land is 20 * $3 = $60.\n\nTo find the total amount of money he will earn, we add the amounts he earned from each sale: $2000 + $600 + $60 = $2660.\n\nTherefore, Abraham will be able to earn a total of $2660 after selling all his unused land. \n\n</think>\n<answer> 2660 </answer>",

The total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei is x + 2x + (2x - 2) + (2x - 2)/2. We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 36 eggs. So, the total number of eggs found by the friends is 36. We can write the equation: x + 2x + (2x - 2) + (2x - 2)/2 = 36. To simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + 2(2x - 2) + 2x - 2 = 72. Combining like terms, we get 8x + 4 - 4 = 72.

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows: \nLet x be the number of pods in the regular box. Then, the number of pods in the new box is 1.2x. We know that the regular box costs $12 and the new box costs $12. Since the new box has 20% more pods, it must cost the same as the regular box. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1.2x = x + 12. Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, the regular box has 10 pods. The new box has 20% more pods, so it has 1.2(10) = 12 pods. \nNow, let's find the cost per pod for the new box. The cost per pod is $12 / 12 = $1 per pod. \nFinally, let's find the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1. Since each cycle requires 1 pod, we can run 1 / $1 = 1 cycle per dollar. \nHowever, we need to find the number of cycles that can be run with the new box for $1.

    "raw": "<think> To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay can make per minute and how many snowballs melt per minute. We can then use this information to determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. \n\nFirst, let's find out how many snowballs Jay can make per minute. Since he can build 20 snowballs in an hour, we can divide 20 by 60 to get the number of snowballs he can make per minute: 20 snowballs/hour / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 snowballs/minute.\n\nNext, let's find out how many snowballs melt per minute. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we can divide 2 by 15 to get the number of snowballs that melt per minute: 2 snowballs/15 minutes / 1 minute/15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs/minute.\n\nNow, let's set up an equation to represent the situation. Let x be the number of minutes it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs. The number of snowballs Jay makes per minute is 1/3, and the number of snowballs that melt per minute is 2/15. So, the net number of snowballs Jay has per minute is (1/3) - (2/15). We can set up the equation: (1/3 - 2/15)x = 60.\n\nTo solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for 3 and 15, which is 15. We can rewrite the equation as (5/15 - 2/15)x = 60. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get (3/15)x = 60.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 15, we get 3x = 900. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 300.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs. \n\nHowever, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, not the number of hours. We need to convert 300 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours. But we are looking for the number of minutes, not hours. So, we need to multiply 5 hours by 60 minutes/hour to get the total number of minutes: 5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes. But this is the same as the number of minutes we found earlier. This is because the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs is the same as the number of minutes we found earlier, which is 300 minutes. \n\nHowever, we are looking for the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, not the number of minutes. We need to find the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, not the number of minutes. We can do this by finding the time it takes for Jay to make 60 snowballs, not the number of minutes. We can do this by dividing 60 by the number of snowballs Jay makes per minute, which is 1/3. So, the time it takes for Jay to make 60 snowballs is 60 / (1/3) = 60 * 3 = 180 minutes. But this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, not the number of minutes it takes for him",
    "answer": "Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.\nAt the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.\nThis means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 \u2013 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.\nIt will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.\n#### 5"

Let's call Jim's age at that time x. Then, John's age at that time would be 2x.\n\nSince Digimon was released 20 years ago, we can set up the following equations:\n\nJohn's current age = John's age 20 years ago + 20\nJim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20\n\nWe are given that John's current age is 28, so we can write:\n\n28 = 2x + 20\n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides gives us:\n\n8 = 2x\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, Jim's age 20 years ago was 4. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to 4:\n\nJim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24\n\nTherefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.\n\nHowever, the question asks for Jim's age in the future, not his current age. Since we are asked for Jim's age in the future, we need to add the number of years that have passed since the release of Digimon to Jim's current age. Since Digimon was released 20 years ago, we add 20 to Jim's current age:\n\nJim's age in the future = 24 + 20 = 44\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.

Since 20 years have passed since the release of Digimon, we need to add 20 to Jim's age at the time of the release of Digimon, which is 4.\n\nJim's age in the future = 4 + 20 = 24\n\nHowever, this is still not the correct answer.

Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we need to first find the number of remaining fish. The remaining fish are the total number of fish minus the number of fish with red stripes: 66 - 22 = 44 fish.

To do this, we need to find the number of fish that have both red stripes and blue stripes. Since we don't have a direct way to calculate this, we can use the fact that the number of fish with red stripes is 22, and the number of fish with blue stripes is 20. We can assume that the number of fish with both red stripes and blue stripes is a subset of the fish with red stripes, and also a subset of the fish with blue stripes. Therefore, the number of fish with both red stripes and blue stripes is the smaller of the two numbers, which is 20. However, this is not the correct answer because we are not considering the fact that some fish may have both red stripes and blue stripes.

In this case, the two sets are the set of fish with red stripes and the set of fish with blue stripes. Let's denote the number of fish with both red stripes and blue stripes as x. Then, the total number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes is 22 + 20 - x.\n\nHowever, we know that the total number of fish is 66, and we are asked to find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 22 + 20 - x = 66 - (number of fish with neither red stripes nor blue stripes). Since we don't have any information about the number of fish with neither red stripes nor blue stripes, we can assume that this number is 0, which is a reasonable assumption since we are only considering the fish with red stripes and blue stripes. Therefore, the equation becomes: 22 + 20 - x = 66.\n\nSolving for x, we get: x = 24.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer because we are not considering the fact that some fish may have both red stripes and blue stripes. To find the correct answer, we need to use the fact that the number of fish with both red stripes and blue stripes is a subset of the fish with red stripes, and also a subset of the fish with blue stripes. Therefore, the number of fish with both red stripes and blue stripes is the smaller of the two numbers, which is 20.\n\nHowever, this is still not the correct answer because we are not considering the fact that some fish may have both red stripes and blue stripes. To find the correct answer, we need to use the fact that the number of fish with both red stripes and blue stripes is a subset of the fish with red stripes, and also",

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books. We have 3 shelves, so we need to find the total number of books that can be held on these shelves: (2x) + (2x) + (2x - 5) = 6x - 5. We know that Elly has 110 books, so the total number of books that can be held on these shelves should be equal to 110: 6x - 5 = 110. Adding 5 to both sides gives us: 6x = 115. Dividing both sides by 6 gives us: x = 19.25. Since the number of books cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number, so the middle shelf can hold 19 books. The bottom shelf can hold 2x = 2 * 19 = 38 books. The top shelf can hold 2x - 5 = 2 * 19 - 5 = 33 books. The total number of books that can be held on these shelves is 19 + 38 + 33 = 90 books.

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, their total weight is 2 * 75 = 150 pounds. The total weight is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1500 pounds. \n\nSince the force required to move the car is 1% of the weight, we can calculate the force by multiplying the total weight by 0.01 (which is 1%). \n\nForce = total weight * 0.01 = 1500 * 0.01 = 15 pounds.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the force required to move the car, which includes the weight of the car, luggage, and children. The force required to move the car is equal to the component of its weight parallel to the hill. We can express this as: F = (total weight) * sin(15\u00b0). \n\nSubstituting the value of total weight, we get: F = 1500 * sin(15\u00b0). \n\nUsing a calculator to find the value of sin(15\u00b0), we get approximately 0.2588. \n\nF = 1500 * 0.2588 = 388.2 pounds.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the force required to move the car, which is 1% of its weight. \n\nThe weight of the car is 1200 pounds, and the weight of the luggage and children is 400 pounds.

Since John already has 4 hot dogs left over, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is $40 - 4 = 36$.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 50 pieces of line. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the total length of line needed, not the number of pieces. Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 50 * 12 = 600 feet of line. \n\nHowever, we need to add the 6 feet of line he already has, so the total length of line he needs to buy is 600 - 6 = 594 feet. \n\nThe final answer is 594.",
    "answer": "200*3 = <<200*3=600>>600 feet of line.\nThe caretaker needs to buy 600-6 = <<600-6=594>>594 feet of line.\n#### 594"

Since the vendor sold them at a 25% profit, the total revenue is 125% of the total cost, which is $80 * 1.25 = $100. Since the vendor sold 50 watermelons, the selling price of each watermelon is the total revenue divided by the number of watermelons, which is $100 / 50 = $2. \n\nSo, the selling price of each watermelon is $2. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the selling price of each watermelon, not the profit. Since the profit is 25% of the cost, the selling price is 125% of the cost, which is $5 * 1.25 = $6.25. \n\nBut we know that the total revenue is $100, and the total cost is $80, so the profit is $100 - $80 = $20. The profit is 25% of the cost, so the cost of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is the cost plus the profit, which is $1.60 + $0.80 = $2.40. \n\nHowever, we also know that the selling price is 125% of the cost, which is $1.60 * 1.25 = $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we also know that the selling price is $2. \n\nThe selling price of each watermelon is $2.40, but we",
