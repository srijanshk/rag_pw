    "raw": "<think> Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find Dana's running speed. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed. So, her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which is 2 x 3 = 6 miles per hour.\n\nNext, we need to find her walking speed. We know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.\n\nNow, we need to find the time she spends running and walking. We know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking. The distance she travels while running is her running speed multiplied by the time she spends running, which is 6 x 2 = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is her walking speed multiplied by the time she spends walking, which is 1.5 x 4 = 6 miles.\n\nFinally, we can find the total distance she travels by adding the distance she travels while running and walking, which is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 18.",
    "answer": "If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nIf two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.\nIf one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.\n#### 18"

This means that if Lylah's salary is L, then Adrien's salary is 1.3L.\n\nWe are also given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% over four years, his current salary is 1.4 times his salary four years ago, which is 1.4 * 40000 = 56000.\n\nSince Adrien's current salary is 1.4 times his salary four years ago, and his salary four years ago was 1.3 times Lylah's salary, we can set up the equation:\n\n1.4 * 1.3L = 56000\n\nTo solve for L, we can divide both sides by 1.4 * 1.3:\n\nL = 56000 / (1.4 * 1.3)\nL = 56000 / 1.82\nL = 30773.08\n\nNow that we know Lylah's salary, we can find Adrien's salary four years ago, which is 1.3L:\n\nAdrien's salary four years ago = 1.3 * 30773.08\n= 40000\n\nThis confirms that Adrien's salary four years ago was indeed $40000.\n\nNow, we need to find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later.

The original price of a bag of marbles is $20.\n2. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. To calculate the price increase, we multiply the original price by 20% (or 0.20).\n3. After the first two months, the price increase is $20 x 0.20 = $4. The new price is $20 + $4 = $24.\n4. After the next two months (total of 4 months), the price increase is $24 x 0.20 = $4.80. The new price is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.\n5. We continue this process for every two months, calculating the price increase and adding it to the current price.\n6. After 6 months, the price increase is $28.80 x 0.20 = $5.76.

After 22 months, the price increase is $123.82 x 0.20 = $24.76. The new price is $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58.\n15. After 24 months, the price increase is $148.58 x 0.20 = $29.72. The new price is $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30.\n16. After 26 months, the price increase is $178.30 x 0.20 = $35.66. The new price is $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96.\n17.

We can substitute J = M + 2 into the second equation to get M - 2 = (1/2)(M + 2) - 5. Simplifying this equation, we get M - 2 = (1/2)M + 1 - 5, which simplifies to M - 2 = (1/2)M - 4. Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get 2M - 4 = M - 8. Subtracting M from both sides, we get M - 4 = -8. Adding 4 to both sides, we get M = -4 + 4, which simplifies to M = 0. Since J = M + 2, we can substitute M = 0 into this equation to get J = 0 + 2, which simplifies to J = 2. However, we are given that Jan is 30, so this solution is incorrect. Let's re-examine the equation M - 2 = (1/2)J - 5. We can rewrite this equation as M - 2 = (1/2)(30) - 5, which simplifies to M - 2 = 15 - 5, which simplifies to M - 2 = 10.

Simplify the equation: 20 dozen cups x cost per cup = $34,800\n5. Convert dozen to a numerical value: 20 dozen = 20 x 12 = 240 cups\n6. Now we have the equation: 240 cups x cost per cup = $34,800\n7. To find the cost per cup, divide both sides of the equation by 240: cost per cup = $34,800 / 240\n8. Calculate the cost per cup: cost per cup = $144\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> 144 </answer>",
    "answer": "Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6\nHalf a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000\nTwenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800\nSince a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.\nIf the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145\n#### 145"

Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.\n\nWe know that there are 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. This means that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.\n\nWe can set up an equation based on this information: x + 2x = 200.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 3x = 200.\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 66.67.\n\nSince x represents the number of books sold in the current year, we know that Elise sold 66.67 books in the current year.

Since she taps at 200 taps per minute with each foot, the total number of taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.\n\nSince she dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, the total number of taps is 400 * 2 = 800.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of taps Helga makes in 5 minutes.

To find the number of times she taps both feet, we need to divide the total number of taps by 2. \n\nSo, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is 2450 / 2 = 1225.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1225.",

We also know that she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. Additionally, she uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x, the amount of salt (and sugar) as y, and the amount of oil as z. We can set up the following equations based on the given information: z = 2y (twice as much oil as salt), y = 2x (twice as much salt as zest), and x + y + z + x + y + z = 10 (the total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces). We can simplify the last equation to 2x + 2y + 2z = 10. Since z = 2y and y = 2x, we can substitute these expressions into the equation to get 2x + 2(2x) + 2(2(2x)) = 10. This simplifies to 2x + 4x + 8x = 10, which further simplifies to 14x = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 10/14 = 5/7. Since y = 2x, we have y = 2(5/7) = 10/7. And since z = 2y, we have z = 2(10/7) = 20/7. Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 20/7 ounces. However, we need to find the numeric value of the amount of oil in ounces, so we can multiply 20/7 by 10/10 to get 200/70, which simplifies to 20/7. To get the final answer, we can multiply 20/7 by 10/10 to get 200/70, which simplifies to 20/7. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 10/10, we get 200/70, which simplifies to 20/7.

The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the weight-based shipping cost is 4 x $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the distance-based shipping cost is 20 x $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.\n\nNext, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. To find 75% of $32, we multiply $32 by 0.75, which is $24.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose. This is the shipping cost minus the refund amount, which is $2.99 - $24 = -$21.99.

We need to find the correct refund amount.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the refund amount. The refund amount is 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. To find 75% of $32, we multiply $32 by 0.75, which is $24. However, the refund amount cannot exceed the shipping cost. Since the shipping cost is $2.99, the refund amount should be $2.99. To find the correct refund amount, we need to find the percentage of the book's purchase price that is equal to the shipping cost. We can set up the equation 0.75x = 2.99, where x is the percentage of the book's purchase price that is equal to the shipping cost. Solving for x, we get x = 2.99 / 0.75 = 3.9867. This means that the refund amount is 3.9867% of the book's purchase price.\n\nNow, let's calculate the refund amount. The refund amount is 3.9867% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.

Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total speed of the 3 kangaroos by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos. \n\nSpeed of 3 kangaroos = Total time / Number of kangaroos = 18 hours / 3 = 6 hours.\n\nSince the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel across the highway.

Since the distance remains the same, we can set up a proportion to relate the speed of the kangaroos to the speed of the turtles.\n\nSpeed of 3 kangaroos = Speed of 4 turtles * (Distance / 4)\n\nWe know that the speed of 3 kangaroos is 6 hours, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n6 = Speed of 4 turtles * (Distance / 4)\n\nSince the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set up another equation using the speed of the kangaroos:\n\nSpeed of 3 kangaroos = Distance / 18\n\nSubstituting the value of the speed of 3 kangaroos, we get:\n\n6 = Distance / 18\n\nDistance = 6 * 18 = 108\n\nNow that we have the distance, we can find the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel across the highway:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed of 4 turtles\n= 108 / (3 * 4)\n= 108 / 12\n= 9 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway. \n\n<answer> 9 </answer>",

The total cost of the balloons is $1.5. They also spent $14 on 2 tubs of ice cream. So, the total amount spent is $11 + $1.5 + $14 = $26.5. Since they spent $26.5 out of 2x, we can set up the equation 2x - $26.5 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = $26.5 / 2 = $13.25.

To do this, we can use the fact that the ratio of the number of balls carried by each boy is 1:2:4.

    "raw": "<think> Let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is x. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices that the adults get is 2a and the total number of slices that the kids get is 4k. We are given that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, so we can set up the equation 2a = 2(4k). Simplifying this equation, we get a = 4k. \n\nSince the total number of slices is x, we can set up the equation 2a + 4k = x. Substituting a = 4k into this equation, we get 2(4k) + 4k = x, which simplifies to 12k = x.\n\nWe are also given that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, so the total number of slices that the adults get is 2(4k) = 8k. \n\nTo find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices that the adults get by the total number of slices and multiply by 100. So, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is (8k / x) * 100.\n\nSubstituting x = 12k into this expression, we get (8k / 12k) * 100 = (2/3) * 100 = 66.67%. \n\nTherefore, each adult gets 66.67% of the watermelon.

We know that L = 2S, since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times that, so it's $12. The total earnings from the sales is $120. We can set up the equation: 4S + 12L = 120. Since L = 2S, we can substitute this into the equation: 4S + 12(2S) = 120. This simplifies to 4S + 24S = 120, which is 28S = 120.

Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, and he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, we can calculate the amount of ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe as follows:\n\nLet x be the amount of ore he can mine with his bare hands. Then, he can mine 2x with an iron pickaxe and 1.5(2x) = 3x with a steel pickaxe.\n\nSince he can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 and solve for x:\n\n3x = 12\nx = 12/3\nx = 4\n\nSo, he can mine 4 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.

However, the problem asks for the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.

The probability that a shaken can is actually shaken is 3/12, since there were 3 shaken cans initially.

    "raw": "<think> Let's start by defining the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We are also given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells. The total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5. Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got (5x + 5)/3 seashells. We are asked to find the number of seashells each person got, so we need to find the value of (5x + 5)/3. To do this, we need to find the value of x first. We know that the total number of seashells collected is 5x + 5, and we also know that the total number of seashells collected is 27 + 2x + x = 4x + 27. Since these two expressions represent the same quantity, we can set them equal to each other and solve for x: 5x + 5 = 4x + 27. Subtracting 4x from both sides gives x + 5 = 27. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives x = 22. Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the expression (5x + 5)/3 to find the number of seashells each person got: (5(22) + 5)/3 = (110 + 5)/3 = 115/3 = 38.33. However, since we are dividing seashells, we can't have a fraction of a seashell. This means that the problem statement is inconsistent, and there is no integer solution.

We know that y = 20x, so y = 20(50) = 1000. The 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.\n\nThe total number of fruits is 1350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 3150.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life is 3150.\n\n<answer> 3150 </answer>",

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which means he loses 2/15 snowballs per minute. To find the net rate at which he gains snowballs, we need to subtract the rate at which they melt from the rate at which he builds them: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute. This means he gains 1/5 snowballs per minute. To find the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 300 / 60 = 5 hours. Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so 2A = V. We can substitute the expression for A from the first equation into the second equation to get 2(V/2) = V, which simplifies to V = 2V. This means that Vanessa runs at half the speed of Aaron, but runs twice as far. We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, so we can set up the equation A * 4 = 16, since Aaron runs 4 miles. Substituting A = V/2 into this equation, we get (V/2) * 4 = 16, which simplifies to 2V = 16. Solving for V, we get V = 8.

The total cost price of 50 watermelons is 50x. The profit on each watermelon is 25% of x, which is 0.25x. The total profit on 50 watermelons is 50 * 0.25x = 12.5x. \n\nThe total selling price of 50 watermelons is the sum of the total cost price and the total profit, which is 50x + 12.5x = 62.5x. \n\nWe are given that the total selling price of 50 watermelons is $80.
