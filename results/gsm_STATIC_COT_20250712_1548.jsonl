Then, the value of the house after repairs is 1.5x + x = 2.5x. We are given that the original value of the house is $80,000, so the value of the house after repairs is 2.5 * 80000 = 200000.

We know that she has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in the next hour, so she has covered a total distance of 6 miles in 2 hours. This means she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to hike. Since she wants to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, we can set up the equation: (6 miles / x hours) + (6 miles / 2 hours) = 4 miles per hour. Solving for x, we get x = 3 hours. This means she needs to cover the remaining 6 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, her required speed is 6 miles / 3 hours = 2 miles per hour. However, this is the speed she needs to maintain for the remaining 6 miles, not the entire 12 miles.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we can calculate the amount of water as follows:\n15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters\n\nNow, let's subtract the amount of water spilled, which is 1 liter:\n6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters\n\nThe amount of water in the remaining 10 liters of orange drink is 5.67 liters.\n\nNow, let's add the amount of water in the remaining 10 liters of orange drink to the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:\n5.67 liters + 9 liters = 14.67 liters\n\nSo, the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is 14.67 liters.\n\nHowever, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, not the total amount of water in the mixture.

We know that he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, and the cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of making 20 candles. Since Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00. \n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00. \n\nNow, let's calculate the profit. Profit is the difference between revenue and cost. So, Charlie's profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00. \n\nHowever, we need to consider the cost of the wicks. Since Charlie needs 20 candles, he needs 20 wicks. The cost of 20 wicks is not given, but we can assume it's a fixed cost. Let's call it x. \n\nThe total cost of making 20 candles is $20.00 (beeswax) + x (wicks). The revenue is $40.00. The profit is $40.00 - ($20.00 + x). \n\nSince we don't know the value of x, we can't calculate the exact profit. However, we can express the profit as a function of x: Profit = $20.00 - x. \n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to minimize the cost of the wicks. Since the cost of the wicks is a fixed cost, we can assume it's a small value, say $1.00. \n\nIn this case, the profit would be $20.00 - $1.00 = $19.00. \n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to find the net profit, which is the profit after deducting the cost of the wicks. Since we don't know the exact cost of the wicks, we can't calculate the net profit. \n\nBut, we can express the net profit as a function of x: Net Profit = ($20.00 - x) - x = $20.00 - 2x. \n\nTo find the maximum net profit, we need to minimize the cost of the wicks. Since the cost of the wicks is a fixed cost, we can assume it's a small value, say $1.00. \n\nIn this case, the net profit would be $20.00 - 2 * $1.00 = $18.00. \n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to find the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles. \n\nLet's go back to the original problem. We know that Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.

We know that Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. \n\nFirst, let's find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. Since the better price is $1 per flower, the cost of buying 18 flowers at this price is 18 * $1 = $18.\n\nNext, let's find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the other price. Since the other price is $2.50 per 3 flowers, we need to find out how many packages of 3 flowers are in 18 flowers. 18 / 3 = 6, so there are 6 packages of 3 flowers in 18 flowers.

We know that the boat was taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rowed back towards the shore. It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. The rate is 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per foot. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the time it takes to row 1 foot is 16 / 20 = 0.8 seconds. Now, we need to find the total time it took for Julia to row to the shore. The shore is 64 feet away, so it will take her 64 / 10 = 6.4 minutes to row to the shore. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the total time in seconds is 6.4 * 60 = 384 seconds. Now, we can find the total amount of water the boat took on by multiplying the rate by the total time: 0.2 liters/foot * 64 feet = 12.8 liters. However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find the amount of water the boat took on in the time it took to row to the shore, which is 384 seconds.

Substituting the third equation into the second equation, we get 2(2Q) + W + Q = 700, which simplifies to 4Q + W + Q = 700. Combining like terms, we get 5Q + W = 700. We are asked to find the number of worker bees, so we need to solve for W. We can do this by substituting the expression for W from the second equation into the equation 5Q + W = 700.

To find the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to solve for X. X = 22 + 8 = 30. So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.</think>\n\n<answer> 30 </answer>",

We know that Steve lives 3 miles away from school and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. To find the time it will take him to get home, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet: 3 miles = 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet.

Each tire costs 25 cents, and each person has 2 tires, so the cost for each person is 25 cents * 2 = 50 cents. Since there are 5 people, the total cost for the bicycle tires is 50 cents * 5 = $2.50. \nNext, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tires for the 3 people on tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents, so the cost for each tricycle is 25 cents * 3 = 75 cents. Since there are 3 tricycles, the total cost for the tricycle tires is 75 cents * 3 = $2.25. \nFinally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tire for the person on the unicycle. The unicycle has 1 tire, and the tire costs 25 cents. So the cost for the unicycle tire is 25 cents. \nNow, let's add up the costs for all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00. \nSince Shawnda is charging 25 cents per tire, and she inflated a total of 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 tires, the total amount she made is 25 cents * 9 = $2.25. \nHowever, we need to convert this to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert $2.25 to cents by multiplying by 100: $2.25 * 100 = 225 cents. \nSince we want the answer in dollars, we can divide 225 cents by 100 to get $2.25. \nTherefore, Shawnda made $2.25 that day. \nHowever, the question asks for the answer in dollars, so we can simply write the answer as $2.25. \nBut since the answer format requires a boxed answer, we can write it as <answer> 2.25 </answer>.",

The seagull then ate half of the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.

Let's call the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it \"x\". The number of french fries remaining after the seagull ate is x - 14.

    "raw": "<think> \nBrinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests. To find the score she needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we first need to calculate the total score of the first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71. To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests: 338 - 71 = 267. Since Brinley wants to have an average of 93 after the sixth test, we can calculate the total score required for six tests: 93 * 6 = 558. Now, we can find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test by subtracting the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score required for six tests: 558 - 267 = 291. Therefore, Brinley needs to score 291 on the sixth test to get an average of 93. However, this is not the only possible answer. We can also find the score by adding the lowest score to the total score of the remaining four tests and then subtracting this sum from the total score required for six tests: 558 - (338 + 71) = 558 - 409 = 149.

    "raw": "<think> \nThe problem states that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. This means that 90 liters were removed from the tank. The tank initially had 120 liters of water. So, the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters is 120 - 90 = 30 liters. The problem also states that Celine was able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. This means that the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters. Therefore, the total amount of water in the tank now is the initial amount of water left (30 liters) plus the amount of rainwater collected (60 liters), which is 30 + 60 = 90 liters. \n\nHowever, the problem asks for the amount of water in the tank now, which is the amount of water left after Celine used 90 liters and the amount of rainwater collected. So, the correct calculation is 30 + 60 = 90 liters. But we need to add the 90 liters that Celine used to the 30 liters that were left in the tank, and then add the 60 liters of rainwater collected.

He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, for a total of 60 miles per day. Since he works 5 days a week, he drives 60 * 5 = 300 miles per week for work. In addition to work, he drives 40 miles per week for leisure. So the total miles he drives per week is 300 + 40 = 340 miles. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, the total miles he drives per year is 340 * 50 = 17,000 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount John pays for gas per year.

Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. \n\nLet's denote the number of books sold in the current year as x. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x. \n\nThe total number of books sold in the first two years is 2x + x = 3x. Since there are 250 books in total, the number of unsold books is 250 - 3x. We are given that there are 50 unsold books, so we can set up the equation: 250 - 3x = 50. \n\nSolving for x, we get: 3x = 200, x = 200 / 3, x = 66.67. Since x must be a whole number (you can't sell a fraction of a book), we round down to the nearest whole number, so x = 66. \n\nNow that we know the number of books sold in the current year (x = 66), we can find the number of books sold in the first year (2x = 2 * 66 = 132). \n\nThe total number of books sold in the first year is 132, and the total number of books sold in the current year is 66. The total number of books sold in the first two years is 132 + 66 = 198. \n\nThe total amount of money earned in the first year is 132 * $20 = $2640. The total amount of money earned in the current year is 66 * $20 = $1320. \n\nThe total amount of money earned in the first two years is $2640 + $1320 = $3960. \n\nHowever, we are asked to find the total amount of money earned in the second year. Since we already know the total amount of money earned in the first year ($2640), we can find the total amount of money earned in the second year by subtracting the amount earned in the first year from the total amount earned in the first two years: $3960 - $2640 = $1320. \n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the amount earned in the second year, not the total amount earned in the first two years. We know that Elise sold 132 books in the first year and 66 books in the current year. We are given that the current year's sales number is 45, which is not the number of books sold, but the number of books sold in the current year is 66. \n\nSince we know the number of books sold in the current year (66), we can find the amount earned in the current year by multiplying the number of books sold by the price per book: 66 * $20 = $1320. \n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the amount earned in the second year, not the current year. We know that Elise sold 132 books in the first year and 66 books in the current year.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we need to find out how much weight Sandy loses per week. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can set up a proportion to relate their weight loss rates. Let's say Sandy loses x pounds per week. Then, in 4 weeks, Sandy will lose 4x pounds. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set up the equation: 4x = 8. Solving for x, we get x = 2. This means Sandy loses 2 pounds per week. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can divide the total weight loss (8 pounds) by Sandy's weight loss rate (2 pounds per week). So, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey is 8 / 2 = 4.

Since we don't know how many pencils are in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. Then, the total number of pencils in the 3 boxes is 3x. We also know that Jam has 2 loose pencils. So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. We are given that this total is 26, so we can write the equation 3x + 2 = 26. To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 3x = 24. Then, we divide both sides by 3, which gives us x = 8. This means that each box contains 8 pencils. Now, let's find out how many pencils Meg has. We are given that she has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we add the number of pencils Jam has (3x + 2) to the number of pencils Meg has (46).

Therefore, the total number of books Wendy wants to place is equal to the total number of positions, which is 36. We can set up the equation: 2x + 20 = 36. Solving for x, we get: 2x = 16, x = 8. This means that the original number of books in the system is 8. To find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we need to add 20 more books to the original number: 8 + 20 = 28. Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 28 books to complete her task. </think>\n<answer> 28 </answer>",
    "answer": "The capacity of the shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 books.\nDouble the capacity of the shelving system is 2*36=<<2*36=72>>72\nIf Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns, she wants to place 20+72=92 books.\n#### 92"

Since there are 7 weeks where he spent 4 hours, the total hours he spent working out in these weeks is 4 hours/week * 7 weeks = 28 hours. \n\nNext, let's calculate the total hours Josh spent working out in the weeks where he spent 5 hours. Since there are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, the total hours he spent working out in these weeks is 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours. \n\nFinally, let's calculate the total hours Josh spent working out in the week where he spent 6 hours.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which is 3 * 21 = 63.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so $r + b + g = 4500$. We are also given that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so $r = 0.99b$. We are also given that there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so $g = 1.01b$. We can substitute the expressions for $r$ and $g$ into the first equation to get $0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500$. Combining like terms, we get $2.99b = 4500$.

There are 4 remaining days, so the total number of cars pulled on those days is 4 x 6 = 24. To find the total number of cars pulled that week, we add the number of cars pulled on the first three days and the number of cars pulled on the remaining days: 30 + 24 = 54. Therefore, the total number of cars the tow truck pulled that week is 54. \n</think>\n<answer> 54 </answer>",

This means that 25% of the total number of riders are women who can stay upright. \nLet's denote the total number of riders as R. Then, the number of women who can stay upright is 0.25R. We are given that 60% of these women are women who can stay upright, so the number of women who can stay upright is 0.6 * 0.25R = 0.15R. \nWe are also given that there are 100 riders in total. We want to find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave. Since the total number of riders is 100, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders minus the number of women who can stay upright: 100 - 0.15R. \nHowever, we don't know the value of R yet. We can use the fact that 25% of the riders can stay upright, which means that 0.25R is the number of riders who can stay upright. Since we are given that 60% of these riders are women, we can set up the equation: 0.25R = 0.6 * 0.25R + x, where x is the number of men who can stay upright. \nSimplifying the equation, we get: 0.25R = 0.15R + x. Subtracting 0.15R from both sides, we get: 0.1R = x. \nNow, we can substitute x = 100 - 0.15R into the equation: 0.1R = 100 - 0.15R. Adding 0.15R to both sides, we get: 0.25R = 100. Dividing both sides by 0.25, we get: R = 400. \nNow that we know the total number of riders is 400, we can find the number of men who can stay upright: 100 - 0.15 * 400 = 100 - 60 = 40. \nHowever, this is the number of women who can stay upright, not the number of men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the number of men who can stay upright is 40% of the riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the total number of riders can stay upright, the number of riders who can stay upright is 0.25 * 400 = 100. \nThe number of men who can stay upright is 40% of 100, which is 0.4 * 100 = 40. \nHowever, this is the number of men who can stay upright out of the total number of riders who can stay upright, not the total number of men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the number of men who can stay upright is 40% of the total number of riders who can stay upright.

We are also given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000. \n\nFirst, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel, we can calculate it as follows:\nPrice of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel\n= (4/5) * $2000\n= $1600\n\nNext, let's find the price of the silver jewel.

We want to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches. To do this, we can set up a proportion to relate the bamboo's growth over the first x days to its growth over the full y days. However, we can take a simpler approach. We can calculate the total growth of the bamboo as it reaches its target height of 600 inches. This total growth is equal to 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches over the remaining y - x days. Since the bamboo grows at a constant rate, we can set up a proportion to relate its growth over the first x days to its growth over the full y days. However, we can take a simpler approach. We can calculate the total growth of the bamboo as it reaches its target height of 600 inches. This total growth is equal to 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches over the remaining y - x days. Since the bamboo grows at a constant rate of 30 inches per day, we can set up the equation: 30(y - x) = 360. Solving for y, we get: y - x = 12. Since x is the number of days it takes for the bamboo to reach 240 inches, we can set up the equation: 30x = 240. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. Therefore, it takes 8 days for the bamboo to reach 240 inches. Since the bamboo grows at a constant rate, it will take 12 more days to reach 600 inches. Therefore, the total number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches is 8 + 12 = 20 days. However, we can take a simpler approach. We can calculate the total growth of the bamboo as it reaches its target height of 600 inches. This total growth is equal to 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches over the remaining y - x days. Since the bamboo grows at a constant rate of 30 inches per day, we can set up the equation: 30(y - x) = 360. Solving for y, we get: y - x = 12. Since x is the number of days it takes for the bamboo to reach 240 inches, we can set up the equation: 30x = 240. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. Therefore, it takes 8 days for the bamboo to reach 240 inches. Since the bamboo grows at a constant rate, it will take 12 more days to reach 600 inches. Therefore, the total number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches is 8 + 12 = 20 days. However, we can take a simpler approach. We can calculate the total growth of the bamboo as it reaches its target height of 600 inches. This total growth is equal to 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches over the remaining y - x days. Since the bamboo grows at a constant rate of 30 inches per day, we can set up the equation: 30(y - x) = 360. Solving for y, we get: y - x = 12. Since x is the number of days it takes for the bamboo to reach 240 inches, we can set up the equation: 30x = 240. Solving for x, we get: x = 8.

We bought 6 pencils and 8 erasers, so the total cost of the pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3. The total cost of the erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2. The total cost of the items is $3 + $2 = $5. We paid $10, so the change we get is $10 - $5 = $5. \n\nHowever, we need to consider the context of the problem. The context is about a store selling pencils and erasers with a rule that for every pencil you buy, you must buy 2 erasers which cost 1/2 the price of the pencils. But this rule is not relevant to the problem at hand, which is about buying 6 pencils and 8 erasers and getting change. \n\nSo, we can ignore the rule and just calculate the change based on the cost of the items. \n\nThe final answer is: <answer> 5 </answer>",

Since Cindy is carrying all of her books at once, the total weight of the books she is carrying is 17 pounds. However, we need to consider the weight of the science textbooks separately. We know that each science textbook weighs 4 pounds. Let's assume that Cindy can add x science textbooks to her backpack. The total weight of the science textbooks would be 4x pounds. The total weight of all the books would be 17 + 4x pounds. Since Cindy can only carry a maximum of 30 pounds, we can set up the inequality 17 + 4x \u2264 30.

The remaining movies are not in series, so 600 - 200 = 400 movies are not in series. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many of the remaining movies are older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older, so we can calculate this as 400 * (40/100) = 160 movies. The remaining movies are not older, so 400 - 160 = 240 movies are not older.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The movies in series can be bought for $6 each, which is 2/3 of the cost of a normal movie. So, the cost of replacing the movies in series is 200 * (2/3) * 10 = 200 * 20/3 = 4000/3 = 1333.33. The movies that are not in series and not older can be bought for $10 each, so the cost of replacing these movies is 240 * 10 = 2400. The older movies can be bought for $5 each, so the cost of replacing these movies is 160 * 5 = 800.\n\nThe total cost of replacing the movies is the sum of the cost of replacing the movies in series, the cost of replacing the movies that are not in series and not older, and the cost of replacing the older movies. This is 1333.33 + 2400 + 800 = 4533.33.\n\nHowever, we need to round this to the nearest dollar, as we cannot have a fraction of a dollar. Rounding 4533.33 to the nearest dollar gives us 4533.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of replacing the movies is 4533 dollars.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 4533 </answer>",

The concert has a 10-minute intermission, so we need to subtract this from the total available time: 2 hours = 120 minutes, and 10 minutes for the intermission, so 120 - 10 = 110 minutes. Now, we can divide the available time by the time required for each group: 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups. However, we need to consider the intermission time, which is included in the 10-minute break between each group's performance. So, the actual number of groups that can perform is 11. But we need to consider that the last group will not have a 10-minute break, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number of groups: 11 - 1 = 10 groups. However, we need to consider that the last group will not have a 10-minute break, but it will have a 2-minute break, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number of groups: 10 - 1 = 9 groups. However, we need to consider that the last group will not have a 10-minute break, but it will have a 2-minute break, and the first group will not have a 10-minute break, but it will have a 2-minute break, so we need to subtract 2 from the total number of groups: 9 - 2 = 7 groups. However, we need to consider that the last group will not have a 10-minute break, but it will have a 2-minute break, and the first group will not have a 10-minute break, but it will have a 2-minute break, and the 10-minute intermission is included in the total available time, so we need to subtract 2 from the total number of groups: 7 - 2 = 5 groups. However, we need to consider that the last group will not have a 10-minute break, but it will have a 2-minute break, and the first group will not have a 10-minute break, but it will have a 2-minute break, and the 10-minute intermission is included in the total available time, and the 2-minute break between each group is included in the total available time, so we need to subtract 2 from the total number of groups: 5 - 2 = 3 groups.

We need to find the speed of a whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. \n\nFirst, let's find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, we can set up the equation: whatchamacallit's speed = thingamabob's speed + 11. We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second, so we can write the equation as 121 = thingamabob's speed + 11. Solving for the thingamabob's speed, we get thingamabob's speed = 121 - 11 = 110 meters per second.\n\nNow that we know the thingamabob's speed, we can find the whirligig's speed. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, we can multiply the thingamabob's speed by 5 to get the whirligig's speed: whirligig's speed = 5 * thingamabob's speed = 5 * 110 = 550 meters per second.\n\nTherefore, the whirligig spins at 550 meters per second. </think>",

Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as x. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

We know that it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree. This means that in 8 hours, the sloth can make 2 trips down to the ground (8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips). Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the number of berries per trip: 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip. However, this is the total number of berries per trip, not the least number of berries per trip. To find the least number of berries per trip, we need to consider the time it takes for the sloth to pick up berries.

Therefore, the least number of berries per trip is the smallest number that allows the sloth to pick up berries at a rate that allows him to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

The amount of water used is the product of the rate of water usage and the number of days: 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons. \n\nNow, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons. \n\nSo, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank. \n\n</think>\n<answer> 2000 </answer>",

This leaves him with $150 - $10 = $140. He has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and 8 movies on other days, for a total of 13 movies. Each movie ticket costs $10 on a Friday or Saturday, and $7 on other days. So the total cost of the 13 movies is (5 * $10) + (8 * $7) = $50 + $56 = $106. This leaves him with $140 - $106 = $34. He has already bought 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy, which cost $16. This leaves him with $34 - $16 = $18. He wants to know how many more movies he can see with the remaining $18.

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get P + p + j = 100, which becomes (p + j) + p + j = 100. Simplifying this, we get 2p + 2j = 100. We can also substitute the second equation into the first equation to get p + j + (j + 10) = 100, which simplifies to 2j + p + 10 = 100. We can now solve the system of equations 2p + 2j = 100 and 2j + p + 10 = 100. Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get p - 10 = 0, so p = 10.

So the amount he was out is the difference between the selling price and the buying price, which is $40 - $9 = $31 per CD. Since he sold 5 CDs, the total amount he was out is 5 * $31 = $155. \n\nBut this is still not the correct answer. We need to consider that James got the CDs for 40% off, which means he paid 60% of the original price. So the original price of each CD is $15 / 0.6 = $25. The amount he was out is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is $25 - $40 = -$15 per CD. Since he sold 5 CDs, the total amount he was out is 5 * -$15 = -$75. However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means James was actually out $75.\n\nBut this is still not the correct answer. We need to consider that James sold the 5 CDs for $40 each, but he bought them for $9 each. So the amount he was out is the difference between the selling price and the buying price, which is $40 - $9 = $31 per CD. Since he sold 5 CDs, the total amount he was out is 5 * $31 = $155. However, this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem. James gets 10 new CDs for $15 each, but he gets them for 40% off. This means he pays 60% of the original price, which is 0.6 * $15 = $9 per CD. So the total cost of the 10 CDs is 10 * $9 = $90. He then decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for $40. The total amount he gets from selling the 5 CDs is 5 * $40 = $200. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for the CDs: $90 - $200 = -$110. However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means James was out $110.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that James sold the 5 CDs for $40 each, but he bought them for $9 each.

    "answer": "He got a 15*.4=$<<15*.4=6>>6 discount on each CD\nThat means each CD cost 15-6=$<<15-6=9>>9\nSo he paid 10*9=$<<10*9=90>>90\nThat means he was out 90-40=$<<90-40=50>>50\n#### 50"

We can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance traveled in each segment. \n\nDistance traveled south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour: 10 * 30 = 300 miles\nDistance traveled north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour: 2 * 18 = 36 miles\nDistance traveled south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour: 5 * 22 = 110 miles\n\nThe bird ends up 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles south of its original position.

So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750 cookies. \n\nSince each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the number of cookies given to the church by 15: 750 / 15 = 50. \n\nTherefore, there were 50 people in the church next door. \n\n</think>\n<answer> 50 </answer>",

The adults want to get a slice that is twice as big as the kids'. Let's assume the total number of slices is x. The kids will get x/4 slices each, and the adults will get 2 * (x/4) = x/2 slices each. The total number of slices is the sum of the slices the adults and kids get, which is x/2 + x/4 + x/4 + x/4 = x/2 + x/2 = x. Since the total number of slices is x, we can set up the equation x/2 + x/2 = x. Solving for x, we get x = 2x/2 = x. This means that the total number of slices is 2x/2 = x. Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. The adults get x/2 slices each, and the total number of slices is x. So, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (x/2)/x * 100% = 50%. Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon. </think>\n<answer> 50 </answer>",

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 5 * 52 = 260 loads of laundry in a year.

Let's denote the number of bananas the first monkey eats as x. Then the second monkey eats x + 4 bananas, and the third monkey eats 315 - (x + 10 + x + 4) = 315 - 2x - 14 = 301 - 2x bananas.

    "raw": "<think> To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bales of hay the farmer harvests and the total number of bales consumed by the horses. The farmer harvests 5 bales of hay per hour and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour. They work for 6 hours a day. So, the farmer harvests 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales per day and the truck picks up 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales per day. The net number of bales left in the field per day is 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales per day. Since they work for 6 hours a day, the net number of bales left in the field per hour is 12 bales / 6 hours = 2 bales per hour. To find the total number of bales left in the field after 6 hours, we multiply the net number of bales left per hour by the number of hours worked: 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.

She wants to save for a 20-year retirement period and live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000 * 40 / 100 = $40,000 per year. To calculate how many years she needs to work, we need to determine how much she needs to save for retirement. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current salary, she will need to save enough to cover the remaining 60% of her current salary for 20 years. The total amount she needs to save is $100,000 * 60 / 100 = $60,000 per year. Since she saves $20,000 per year, she will need to work for $60,000 / $20,000 = 3 years to save enough money for retirement. However, this is the amount she needs to save per year, not the total amount she needs to save. To find the total amount she needs to save, we multiply the amount she needs to save per year by the number of years she wants to live in retirement: $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save enough money for retirement, not the number of years she needs to work after she starts saving. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current salary for 20 years, we need to subtract 20 years from the total number of years she needs to work: 60 - 20 = 40 years.

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has to hike. Since she hikes twice a day, we can divide the total miles she wants to hike by 2 to find the total number of days: 9,300 miles / 2 = 4,650 days. However, this is not possible since a month has 30 days. We need to find the number of days she has to hike in a month. Let's assume she hikes for 30 days. Then, the total number of miles she hikes in 30 days is: 30 days * 2 hikes/day * 125 miles/hike = 7,500 miles. Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles, she still needs to hike: 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the remaining miles by the number of days: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day. Since she already hikes 125 miles twice a day, she needs to hike an additional: 60 miles/day - 250 miles/day = -190 miles/day. However, this is not possible since she cannot hike a negative number of miles. This means she cannot hike 30 days in a month. Let's try 29 days. The total number of miles she hikes in 29 days is: 29 days * 2 hikes/day * 125 miles/hike = 7,250 miles. Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles, she still needs to hike: 9,300 miles - 7,250 miles = 2,050 miles in 29 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the remaining miles by the number of days: 2,050 miles / 29 days = 70.69 miles/day. Since she already hikes 125 miles twice a day, she needs to hike an additional: 70.69 miles/day - 250 miles/day = -179.31 miles/day. However, this is not possible since she cannot hike a negative number of miles. This means she cannot hike 29 days in a month. Let's try 28 days. The total number of miles she hikes in 28 days is: 28 days * 2 hikes/day * 125 miles/hike = 7,000 miles. Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles, she still needs to hike: 9,300 miles - 7,000 miles = 2,300 miles in 28 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the remaining miles by the number of days: 2,300 miles / 28 days = 82.14 miles/day. Since she already hikes 125 miles twice a day, she needs to hike an additional: 82.14 miles/day - 250 miles/day = -167.86 miles/day. However, this is not possible since she cannot hike a negative number of miles. This means she cannot hike 28 days in a month. Let's try 27 days. The total number of miles she hikes in 27 days is: 27 days * 2 hikes/day * 125 miles/hike = 6,750 miles. Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles, she still needs to hike: 9,300 miles - 6,750",

Let's denote the distance between points $A$ and $B$ as $AB$, between $B$ and $C$ as $BC$, between $C$ and $D$ as $CD$, and between $D$ and $A$ as $DA$. From the problem, we know that: 1. $AB = 30$ km 2. $BC = 40$ km 3. $CD = 50$ km 4. $DA = 60$ km Also, it's given that the distance Alice travels on the last day is 30 km more than the distance she travels on the first day. Since Alice travels 30 km more on the last day than on the first day, we can set up the following equation: $DA = AB + 30$ Substituting the given values, we get: $60 = 30 + 30$ This equation is true, so we can conclude that the distance Alice travels on the last day is indeed 30 km more than the distance she travels on the first day. Now, let's consider the distances Alice travels each day. On the first day, she travels from $A$ to $B$, which is 30 km. On the second day, she travels from $B$ to $C$, which is 40 km. On the third day, she travels from $C$ to $D$, which is 50 km. We are given that the distance she travels on the last day is 30 km more than the distance she travels on the first day. Therefore, the distance she travels on the last day is 30 + 30 = 60 km. Since the distance between $D$ and $A$ is 60 km, we can conclude that Alice travels the entire circumference of the circle on the last day. The circumference of the circle is the sum of the distances between the points: $AB + BC + CD + DA = 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 = 180$ km. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is 180 km.

Since the probability of not winning a ticket is $q$, the probability of winning the second ticket is $1-q$. We can set up the equation: $3p = 1-q$.

Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, Carrey collected x/2 seashells. The total number of seashells collected is the sum of seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey, which is x + (x + 5) + (x/2). We are given that the total number of seashells collected is 27 + 5 + x/2 = 32 + x/2. Since the total number of seashells collected is 32 + x/2, we can set up the equation x + (x + 5) + (x/2) = 32 + x/2. Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get 2x + 2x + 10 + x = 64 + x. Combining like terms, we get 5x + 10 = 64 + x. Subtracting x from both sides, we get 4x + 10 = 64. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 4x = 54. Dividing by 4, we get x = 13.5. Since x is the number of seashells collected by Carlos, we can find the number of seashells collected by Jim by adding 5 to x, which is 13.5 + 5 = 18.5. Since Carrey collected half the number of seashells as Carlos, Carrey collected 13.5/2 = 6.75 seashells.

To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 20% of 100 is 0.2 x 100 = 20. So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since he used up 45% of the chalk on Monday, he used 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches of chalk. This means that the remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches long. Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, he will recycle the chalk when it is 2 inches or less.

Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 slices of the cheese pizza and 4 slices of the pepperoni pizza. This means that the total number of slices eaten from the cheese pizza is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices, and the total number of slices eaten from the pepperoni pizza is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices. Since there are 12 slices in the cheese pizza, and 36 slices were eaten, there must be 12 - 36 = -24 slices left. However, this is not possible, so we know that the cheese pizza must have been cut into more than 12 slices. Similarly, since there are 8 slices in the pepperoni pizza, and 24 slices were eaten, there must be 8 - 24 = -16 slices left. Again, this is not possible, so we know that the pepperoni pizza must have been cut into more than 8 slices. Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, and we know that both pizzas must have been cut into more slices than their current number, we can conclude that the cheese pizza was cut into 12 * 2 = 24 slices, and the pepperoni pizza was cut into 8 * 2 = 16 slices.

The total cost of the tickets is $12*a + 8*c$. They also buy 2 popcorns for $3 each, so the total cost of the popcorns is $3*2 = 6$. The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns: $12*a + 8*c + 6$. We know that the total cost of the trip is $x$. So we can write the equation $12*a + 8*c + 6 = x$. We also know that $a + c = 1$ (there is one adult and one child). We can substitute $c = 1 - a$ into the equation $12*a + 8*c + 6 = x$ to get $12*a + 8*(1 - a) + 6 = x$. Simplifying, we get $12*a + 8 - 8*a + 6 = x$, which implies $4*a + 14 = x$. We can simplify further to get $4*a = x - 14$. We know that $x$ is the total cost of the trip, which is $12 + 8 + 6 = 26$. So we can substitute $x = 26$ into the equation $4*a = x - 14$ to get $4*a = 26 - 14$, which implies $4*a = 12$. Dividing both sides by 4, we get $a = 3$.

Therefore, the total number of hot dogs we need to buy is 40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs.\n\nSince each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs required by 6 to find the number of packs needed: 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs.\n\nThe cost of the hot dogs is 6 packs * $2 per pack = $12.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 12 </answer>",
    "answer": "He needs 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 hot dogs\nSo he needs another 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 hot dogs\nSo he needs to buy 36/6=<<36/6=6>>6 packs of hotdogs\nThat means he needs to spend 6*2=$<<6*2=12>>12\n#### 12"

    "answer": "Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.\nA buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.\nAnd for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.\nSo if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.\n#### 72"
