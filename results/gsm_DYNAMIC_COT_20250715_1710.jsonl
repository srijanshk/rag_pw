Her new salary is:\n\n1.4x = 1.4(30769.23)\n= 43156.52\n\nNow, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:\n\nTotal salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary\n= 56000 + 43156.52\n= 99156.52\n\n<answer>99156.52</answer>",
    "answer": "Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.\nIn total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000\nIf four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.\nFour years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000\nAfter receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200\nIn total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.\nThe total amount of salary the two earn four years later is $39200+$56000 = $<<39200+56000=95200>>95200\n#### 95200",

We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32\nSubtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16\nDividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8",

Since he paid $48 in total, and the CD costs $4, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - 4x. \n\nWe want to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set, so we need to find the value of x + 1 (since he would have bought one more CD). \n\nThe cost of the headphone set is $48 - 4x, so the cost of x + 1 CDs is 4(x + 1). We can set up the equation:\n\n4(x + 1) = 48 - 4x\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n4x + 4 = 48 - 4x\n\nAdding 4x to both sides, we get:\n\n8x + 4 = 48\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get:\n\n8x = 44\n\nDividing both sides by 8, we get:\n\nx = 5.5\n\nSo Tom bought 5.5 CDs. If he had not bought the headphone set, he could have bought 5.5 + 1 = 6.5 CDs.\n\nSince you can't buy a fraction of a CD, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Tom could have bought 6 CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.\n\n<answer>6</answer>",

Since the new rope costs $1.5 per meter, the total cost will be:\n\nx meters x $1.5/meter = $1.5x\n\nSince Sarah wants to buy a new rope, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\n$40 - $1.5x = 0\n\nWe want to find the value of x, but we are actually interested in the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope. To find this, we need to subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount of money Sarah got from selling the old rope:\n\n$40 - $1.5x\n\nSince we want to find the amount of money left over, we can set up an equation:\n\n$40 - $1.5x = y\n\nwhere y is the amount of money left over.\n\nNow, we need to solve for y. Since we know that Sarah will buy a new rope, we can assume that x is a positive value. We can also assume that x is less than or equal to 20, since Sarah can't buy a rope longer than the original rope.\n\nTo solve for y, we can isolate the variable x:\n\n$40 - y = $1.5x\n\n$1.5x = $40 - y\n\nx = ($40 - y) / $1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of x, since Sarah can't buy a rope longer than the original rope. We can set up an inequality:\n\n0 \u2264 x \u2264 20\n\nSubstituting the expression for x, we get:\n\n0 \u2264 ($40 - y) / $1.5 \u2264 20\n\nMultiplying both sides by $1.5, we get:\n\n0 \u2264 $40 - y \u2264 $30\n\nSubtracting $40 from all sides, we get:\n\n-$40 \u2264 -y \u2264 -$10\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get:\n\n40 \u2265 y \u2265 10\n\nSince y represents the amount of money left over, we can conclude that Sarah will have at least $10 and at most $40 left over after buying the new rope.\n\nHowever, we are asked to provide a single numeric answer. To do this, we need to find the maximum value of y, which occurs when x is maximum. Since x is maximum when x = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression for y:\n\ny = $40 - $1.5(20)\n= $40 - $30\n= $10\n\nSo, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.\n\n<answer>$10</answer>",

    "raw": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to save that amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will need to save 60% of her current annual salary for 20 years. \n\n60% of $100,000 is $60,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need to save $60,000 x 20 = $1,200,000.\n\nSince Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck, she needs to save $1,200,000 / 0.2 = $6,000,000 in total.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many years she needs to work to save this amount. Since she saves $20,000 per year (20% of $100,000), she needs to work for $6,000,000 / $20,000 = 300 years.\n\nHowever, this is not possible, as Lauren cannot work for 300 years. This means that the initial assumption that she can save 20% of her paycheck is not feasible.\n\nLet's recalculate the number of years she needs to work if she saves 20% of her paycheck. We will use the formula for compound interest, A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount she needs to save, P is the principal (the amount she saves each year), r is the interest rate (which is 0 in this case, since she is not earning interest), and n is the number of years.\n\nWe know A = $6,000,000, P = $20,000, and r = 0. We need to solve for n.\n\nSince r = 0, the formula simplifies to A = Pn. Therefore, n = A / P = $6,000,000 / $20,000 = 300 years.\n\nHowever, this is still not possible. Let's try to find the number of years she needs to work if she saves 20% of her paycheck, assuming she earns interest on her savings.\n\nLet's use the formula for compound interest, A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount she needs to save, P is the principal (the amount she saves each year), r is the interest rate, and n is the number of years.\n\nWe know A = $6,000,000, P = $20,000, and r is the interest rate. We need to solve for n.\n\nSince we don't know the interest rate, let's assume it's x. Then, the formula becomes $6,000,000 = $20,000(1 + x)^n.\n\nWe can divide both sides by $20,000 to get 300 = (1 + x)^n.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. Since Lauren is saving 20% of her paycheck, the interest rate is 0.2. However, this is not the interest rate we are looking for, since we are assuming she earns interest on her savings.\n\nLet's try to find the interest rate that will allow her to save $6,000,000 in 300 years. We can use the formula for compound interest, A = P(1 + r)^n, and solve for r.\n\nWe know A = $6,000,000, P = $20,000, and n = 300. We can plug these values into the formula to get $6,000,000 = $20,000(1 + r)^300.\n\nWe can divide both sides by $20,000 to get 300 = (1 + r)^300.\n\nNow, we can take the 300th root of both sides to get 1 + r = 1.001.\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives us r = 0.001.\n\nNow that we have the interest rate, we can plug it back into the formula for compound interest to find the number of years she needs to work.\n\nA = P(1 + r)^n\n$6,000,000 = $20,000(1 + 0.001)^n\n\nWe can divide both sides by $20,000 to get 300 = (1.001)^n.\n\nNow, we can take the logarithm of both sides to get log(300) = n log(1.001).\n\nWe can divide both sides by log(1.001) to get n = log(300) / log(1.001).\n\nUsing a calculator, we get n \u2248 300.0003.\n\nSince we can't work with a fraction of a year, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for approximately 301 years to save $6,000,000.\n\nHowever, this is still not possible, as Lauren cannot work for",

However, we can use the fact that the total number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes is equal to the total number of fish minus the number of fish without red or blue stripes.\n\nThe number of fish without red or blue stripes is 66 - 22 - 20 = 24.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes: 22 + 20 = 42.\n\nHowever, this includes the fish that have both red and blue stripes twice, so we need to subtract the number of fish without red or blue stripes to get the correct count: 42 - 24 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 18.\n\n<answer>18</answer>",
    "answer": "One-third of the fish in the fish tank have red stripes, a total of 1/3*66 = <<1/3*66=22>>22 fish\nThe number of fish in the fish tank with no red stripes is 66-22 =<<66-22=44>>44\n5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, a total of 5/11*44 = <<5/11*44=20>>20 fish\nAltogether, the number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 20+22 = <<20+22=42>>42 fish\n#### 42",

Then, V = 2 * 2 = 4. Substituting V = 4 into the equation 4 = 4Vt, we get: 4 = 4 * 4 * t, which simplifies to 4 = 16t.\n\nDividing both sides by 16, we get: t = 4/16 = 1/4.\n\nSo, Vanessa took 1/4 of an hour, or 15 minutes, to complete her part of the race.\n\n<answer>15</answer>",
